## Notes for Dan Abramov's egghead.io Videos [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/issues)

#### 1. The Single Immutable State Tree (*Principal #1*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree

The **first principal** to learn in Redux is that you are going to represent your whole
application ("State") as a single JavaScript Object. All changes and mutations
to the state in Redux are *explicit* so it is possible to keep track of all of them.

In this video Dan shows how the state of a Todo app changes over time as
data is added and filters applied; its a *glimpse* of power of the single state tree.

<br />

#### 2. Describing State Changes with Actions (*Principal #2*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-describing-state-changes-with-actions

The **second principal** of Redux is that the **state tree** is ***read-only***;
you cannot modify or write to it, instead, any time you want to change the state
you need to dispatch an action. (i.e. *you can only "update" the state using a function*...)
An action is a *plain Javascript Object* describing the change.
Just like the state is the minimal representation of data in your app,
the action is the minimal representation of the change to that data.
The only requirement of an action is that it has a `type` property
(*this more a description for your action*). The convention is to use a `String`
because they are serializable (*i.e. easy to `JSON.stringify`*)

> "*Any data that gets into your Redux Application gets there by actions*"

<br />

#### 3. *Pure* and *Impure* Functions

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-pure-and-impure-functions

Pure functions depend solely on the values of the arguments.
Pure functions do not have any (*observable*) side-effects such as network
or database calls. Pure functions just calculate the new value [of the state].

The functions you write in redux need to be pure.

#### 4. The Reducer Function (*Principal #3*)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-reducer-function

The UI/View layer of an application is most predictable when it is described
as a pure function of the application state. Pioneered by ~~React~~ [Ractive](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive) and now adopted by several other
frameworks, Redux compliments this approach with another idea:
the state mutations in your app need to be described as a pure function
that takes the previous state and the action being "dispatched" (*performed*)
and returns the next state of your app.

Inside any Redux app there is one function that takes the state of the whole
application and the action being dispatched and returns the next state of
the whole application. It is important that it does not modify the state given
to it; it has to be pure, so it has to `return` a new `Object`
Even in *large* applications there is still just a simple function
that manages how the next state is calculated based on the previous state
of the whole application and the action being dispatched.
It does not have to be slow, for example: if I change the visibility filter
I have to create the new object for the whole state, but I can keep the
reference to the previous version of the Todo's array because the list of
todos has not changed when we change the visibility filter; this is what makes
Redux fast.

> this is the 3rd and final principal of Redux: to describe state changes
you have to write a function that takes the previous state of the app
and the action being dispatched and returns the next state.
The function has to be pure and is called the "Reducer".

<br />

#### 5. Writing a Counter Reducer with Tests

This video walks through creating a basic counter in Redux.

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-writing-a-counter-reducer-with-tests

The first [*and only*] function in this video is the Reducer for the counter example.
A reducer accepts state and action as arguments and returns the next state.

Before writing any code, we write a few assertions (*tests*) using
[**Michael Jackson**](https://github.com/mjackson)'s
(*Yes, there's a* ***developer*** *with that name... and he's* ***really good***)
***Expect*** (testing/assertion) **library**: https://github.com/mjackson/expect

We assert that when the state of the counter is zero and you pass an `INCREMENT`
action, it should return 1.

```js
expect (
  counter(0, { type: 'INCREMENT' })
).toEqual(1);
```

And similarly when the counter is 1 and we `INCREMENT` it should return 2.

```js
expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'INCREMENT' })
).toEqual(2);

// We add a test that check how `DECREMENT` works; from 2 to 1 and from 1 to zero:

expect (
  counter(2, { type: 'DECREMENT' })
).toEqual(1);

expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'DECREMENT' })
).toEqual(0);
```

If we run these tests [*in the browser*], they will fail because we have not
even *begun* to implement the reducer.
We are going to start by checking the action type.
If the action type is `INCREMENT` we are going to `return state + 1` (*state plus one*)
If the type is `DECREMENT` we are going to `return state - 1` (*state minus one*)

```js
if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
  return state + 1;
} else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
  return state - 1;
}
```

If you run the tests, you will find that that this is enough to get them to pass.
> *Code for*
[***Video 5 @ 1:15*** ](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/8ded8853d5a789f94aff410eef0799bb66926a0d/index.html#L15)

However, there are still some flaws in our implementation of the counter reducer.
If we dispatch an action that it [*the reducer*] does not understand,
it should return the current state of the application.

```js
expect (
  counter(1, { type: 'SOMETHING_ELSE' })
).toEqual(1);
```

However if we check for that, we will see that this test fails
because we currently don't handle unknown actions.
So I'm going to add an `else` clause that returns the current state
and the tests pass now.

```js
if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
  return state + 1;
} else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
  return state - 1;
} else {
  return state;
}
```

And the tests pass now.

> *Code for*
[***Video 5 @ 1:49*** ](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/d6c9051922e288583d5f43c45dbf3a57f1113648/index.html#L15)

Another issue is that while the reducer is in control of the application state,
*currently* it does not specify the initial state; in the case of the counter
example that would be zero.

The convention in Redux is that if the reducer receives `undefined` as the
`state` argument, it *must* `return` what it considers to be the initial
`state` of the application. In this case it will be zero.

> *Code for*
[***Video 5 @ 2:15*** ](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/36775c88bb9d236f4918b1721c4d72c3ac8820a1/index.html#L18)

"*Now come a few* ***cosmetic tweaks***" ... At the end of the video Dan replaces
the `if/else` blocks with a `switch` statement* - which we *agree* is *neater* (*and works in* ***all browsers***)

```js
switch (action.type) {
  case 'INCREMENT':
    return state + 1;
  case 'DECREMENT':
    return state - 1;
  default:
    return state;
}
```

*However* Dan *also* makes a couple of changes which are *not* just "*cosmetic*":
changing the reducer function to be an **ES6**
[`Arrow Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and also includes an **ES6** [`default parameter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters)
syntax to specify what the state should be if its undefined.

The reducer function written in ES5 (*Works in* ***ALL Browsers***):
```js
function counter(state, action) {
  state = state || 0; // default parameter assignment before ES6
  /* reducer code here */
}
```
is re-written using ES6 features: (***Only Chrome*** *fully-supports both these new features*)

```js
const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
  /* reducer code here */
}
```

***Arrow functions*** can be fewer characters to type but are
[***not supported***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Browser_compatibility)
in **Safari** *or* **Internet Explorer**
[*at the time of writing*] ...
![ES6-arrow-functions-not-supported-in-safari-or-internet-explorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12050430/5800888c-aeed-11e5-91fb-0bb8ff2ae4a4.png)

***Default parameters*** are a *nice* addition to JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) because
they make it clear what the default value of the parameter should be if its unset,
however they are
[***not supported***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters#Browser_compatibility) in **Internet Explorer**, **Safari** *or* **Opera** [*at the time of writing*] ...
![es6-default_parameters-browser_compatibility](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12050412/095e590c-aeed-11e5-8dae-a8a4105715fb.png)

These browsers still account for between 30%-50% of people using the internet in December 2015
(*depending on the age/geography of the people using your app...
see*:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers )
And considering that *most* people take *ages* to upgrade to the latest browser
Microsoft ***Internet Explorer 8*** *still has*
[***10%*** *market share*!](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0)
and is [still available](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-8-details.aspx)
to be downloaded.

using ES6 features has two implications:
+ If you want to run the code in a browser you need Google Chrome ***Canary***.
+ And/Or, You need to "*transpile*" (*convert*) your code using ***Babel*** before running it in browsers.

We will come back to Babel later...

#### 6. Store Methods: getState(), dispatch(), and subscribe()

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-store-methods-getstate-dispatch-and-subscribe
> Code: [Video 6 Code Snapshot]( https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/2430c6e95eacd61ebf7ff4a660cc64e80c9e883e/index.html)

Video #6 picks up from where #5 finished, so if you skipped
video 5, go back and watch it, and try writing/running the code!

Dan starts off by showing how to include Redux (*from CDN JS*)
in a client-side app so we can start using the methods.
This is not the *recommended* way of loading Redux, but works fine for this
example/demo.

"*In real applications I suggest you use npm and a module bundler like
webpack or browserify*".


In this tutorial we are using a single function from Redux called `createStore`.

Using **ES6** [**destructuring assignment**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
syntax to extract the `createStore` method from Redux:

```js
const { createStore } = Redux;  // 6 fewer characters to type. OMG! what will we do with all that extra free time?!
// this is equivalent to:
var createStore = Redux.createStore;
```

"The store binds together the **3 Principals** of Redux,
it holds the current application state object, it lets you dispatch actions.
When you create it [the store] you need to specify the reducer that tells
how to update the state with actions.
In this example we are calling `createStore` with `counter` as the reducer
that manages the state updates."

Redux Store has **3** (*important*) **methods**:

+ `getState` - retrieves the current state of the Redux store. In the case of our counter the initial state is Zero.
+ `dispatch` - lets you dispatch actions to change the state of your application.
if we log the state of the application after dispatching an action (e.g: `INCREMENT`), we see that the state has changed to 1.
(*the most commonly used method*)
+ `subscribe` - lets you register a callback that the Redux store will call
any time an action has been dispatched. so you can update the UI of your application to reflect the current application state.

The code at the end of video #6 looks like this: (*explanatory comments added*)

      const counter = (state = 0, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
          case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + 1;
          case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - 1;
          default:
            return state;
        }
      }

      const { createStore } = Redux; // Redux is GLOBAL Object from redux.min.js
      // create the store for our mini-app using the counter reducer
      const store = createStore(counter);
      console.log(store.getState()); // counter should be 0 (zero)

      store.dispatch({type:'INCREMENT'}); // increment from zero to one
      console.log(store.getState()); // counter is 1 (one)

      const render = () => { // render function updates DOM with counter value
        document.body.innerText = store.getState();
      }
      store.subscribe(render); // all actions re-render the DOM
      render(); // render the initial state of the page/app

      // listen for click event on the whole document (click anywhere on the page)
      document.addEventListener('click', () => {
        store.dispatch({type:'INCREMENT'});
      });

#### 7. Implementing Store from Scratch

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-implementing-store-from-scratch
> Code: [Video #7 Code Snapshot](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/17432aacb7e75702fe66338d9eacf27ffcca33c7/index.html#L15-L43)

In the 7<sup>th</sup> Video Dan shows how the Redux store is *implemented*
in ***20 lines of code***:

```js
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () => state; // return the current state (object)

  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };
  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    return () => { // removing the listener from the array to unsubscribe listener
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    };
  };

  dispatch({});

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
}
```

"Because the subscribe function can be called many times,
we need to keep track of all the changed listeners.
And any time it is called we want to push the new listener into the (`listeners`) array.
Dispatching an action is the only way to change the internal state.
in order to calculate the new state we call the reducer with the state
and the action being dispatched.
And after the state is updated we need to notify every change listener by calling it.
1:44 - There is an important missing piece here: we have not provided a way
to unsubscribe a listener. But instead of adding a dedicated `unsubscribe` method,
we will just return a function from the subscribe method that removes this listener from the `listeners` array.
2:03 - Finally by the time the store is returned we want it to have the initial
state populated. so we are going to dispatch a dummy action just to get the
reducer to return the initial value.
2:18 - this implementation of the Redux store is (*apart from a few minor details
  and edge cases*) is the `createStore` we ship with Redux."

#### 8. React Counter Example

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-react-counter-example

"In the simplest counter example I update the `document.body` *manually*
any time the store state changes, but of course this approach does not scale
to complex applications. So instead of manually updating the DOM I'm going
to use React."

I'm adding two scripts to the `<head>` corresponding to React and [React-DOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html)
and a `root` div to render to:

```js
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.5/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.5/react-dom.min.js"></script>
```
> These scripts are available on CDNJS: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react/
You can opt to use `fb.me` as your React CDN if you *prefer*.

So now I can call `ReactDOM.render` with my root component.
The render function is called any time the store state changes,
so I can safely pass the sate of the store as a `prop` to my
root component.

```js
const Counter = ({ value }) => (
  <h1>{value}</h1>
);

const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Counter value={store.getState()}/>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
};
```

Since the state is held inside the Redux Store the counter component can
be a simple function which is a supported way of declaring components
since React version `0.14`.

Now I want to add increment and decrement buttons to the component,
but I don't want to *hard-code* the Redux dependency into the component,
so I just add `onIncrement` and `onDecrement` props as callbacks.

In my render method I pass the callbacks that call `store.dispatch`
with appropriate actions.
Now the application state is updated when I click the buttons.

by the *end* of Video 8 your code should look like this:
[`index.html`](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/a6cbc789e078d8c42a73066dbb94adf8bd5a7f3f/index.html#L19-L72)

##### *Recap*

[1:20] Now let's recap how this application works.

The `counter` component is what I call a "*dumb component*",
it does not contain *any* business logic, it only specifies how the current application state transforms into renderable output
and how the callback passed via props are bound to the event handlers.

When we render a counter we specify that its `value` should be taken
from the Redux `store` *current* state.
And when the user presses `increment` [button] or `decrement` [button]
we dispatch the corresponding action to the Redux store.

Our reducer specifies how the *next* state is calculated based on the
*current* state and the `action` being dispatched.

And *finally* we subscribe to the Redux store so our `render` function
runs any time the state changes, so the `counter` [component]
gets the *current* state.



#### Notes on using JSX Syntax in React in Browsers

*Most* React.js Examples are written using
[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) syntax.
This is not *standard* JavaScript so no browser can *understand* it.

If you want the Counter *example* to work in the browser (*without having to compile your counter component with babel*) you will need to include the `JSXTransformer`:

```js
<script src="https://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.13.3.js"></script>
```
**note**: in-browser compilation of JSX is [not recommended](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/06/12/deprecating-jstransform-and-react-tools.html#other-deprecations) for "*Production*" use.
instead you will need to *compile* your JSX to JS using Babel...

For more detail,
read: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tooling-integration.html#jsx

Don't forget to add `type="text/jsx"` to your script tag in `index.html`
to ensure that the JSX in the React Component is transformed.

#### 9. Avoiding Array Mutations with concat(), slice(), and ...spread

In this video we learn how to avoid mutating arrays using concat(), slice(), and the ES6 array spread operator.

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-avoiding-array-mutations-with-concat-slice-and-spread

"In this lesson I use the *expect* library to make assertions
and [**deep-freeze**](https://github.com/substack/deep-freeze) to make sure my code is ***free*** *of* ***mutations***."

```js
<script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/expect@latest"></script>
<script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/deep-freeze@latest"></script>
```
These are loaded from [@Substack](https://github.com/substack)'s CDN: https://wzrd.in

"Let's say that I want to implement a **counter** ***list*** application.
I would need to write a few function that operate on its state and
its state is an `Array` of JavaScript *Numbers* representing the individual counters."

The first function I want to write is called addCounter
and all it should do is to *append* a zero at the end
of the passed `Array`.


```js
const addCounter = (list) => {
  // write the tests first then implement the function to make them pass.
};

const testAddCounter = () => {
  const listBefore = [];
  const listAfter  = [0];

  deepFreeze(listBefore);

  expect(
    addCounter(listBefore)
  ).toEqual(listAfter);
}

testAddCounter();
console.log('All tests passed.');
```

At first I use the
[`Array.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)
method to add an item at the end of the `Array`, and it works.
> Snapshot of code for [Video 9 @ 0:36](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-redux/blob/65fd87d59a91ca1b12fb8b3a3d1e5516ee520174/index.html#L17-L20)

*However* we need to learn to ***avoid mutations*** in Redux
and I'm enforcing this by calling `deepFreeze` on the original array.
Now my attempt to `.push` does not work; it cannot add a new property to a "frozen" object.
Instead of `.push` I'm going to use the `concat` method which does not *modify* the array.

```js
const addCounter = (list) => {
  return list.concat([0]);
};
```

Now the tests pass without *mutations*.

And I can also use the new **ES6** [***spread operator***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
to write the code in a more concise way:

```js
const addCounter = (list) => {
  return [...list, 0];
};
```

> **Note**: *Again*, (at the time of writing) You will need to be running
[**Chrome**](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/browser/canary.html) or
[**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/)
for this example to work because the
[***spread operator***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
is still [***not*** *(yet)* ***supported***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Browser_compatibility) in *all* browsers ... even though it is a *Standard* ...


The next function is `removeCounter` and it accepts two arguments: `list` (*an `Array` of `Numbers`*) and `index` the `Number` to *skip* from the `Array`.

So if I've got three numbers
and I'm passing 1 as the second argument,
I expect to receive an `Array` with *two* items with the *second* item *skipped* in the `Array`:


```js
const testRemoveCounter = () => {
  const listBefore = [0, 10, 20];
  const listAfter  = [0, 20];
  expect(
    removeCounter(listBefore, 1)
  ).toEqual(listAfter);
};
```

*Usually* to `delete` an item from an `Array` I would use the `splice` method.
However `splice` is a mutating method, so you can't use it in Redux.
I'm going to `deepFreeze` the (`listBefore`) `Array` object,
and now I need to figure out a *different* way of removing an item from
the array *without mutating it*.
I'm using a method called `slice` here and it does not have *anything* to do with `splice`; it is ***not mutating*** and it gives me a part of the `Array` from some beginning to some end index.
So what I am doing is taking the parts before the index I want to skip
and after the index I want to skip
and I `concat` them to get a new array:

```js
const removeCounter = (list, index) => {
  return list
    .slice(0, index)
    .concat(list.slice(index+1));
};
```

Finally, instead of writing it as a method chain with `concat` calls,
I can use the **ES6** [***spread operator***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
to write it more concisely:

```js
const removeCounter = (list, index) => {
  return [
    ...list.slice(0, index),
    ...list.slice(index + 1)
  ];
};
```

> **Note**: *make* ***sure*** *you* ***understand*** *how* ***both***
*of these work before proceeding ... Dan is a big fan of his ES6; he uses it* ***everywhere***!

Now that we have implemented adding and removing counters,
lets implement *incrementing* the counter:

```js
incrementCounter = (list, index) => {

};

// write a test/assertion before implementing the function:
testIncrementCounter = () => {
  const listBefore = [0, 10, 20];
  const listAfter  = [0, 11, 20];

  expect(
    incrementCounter(listBefore, 1)
  ).toEqual(listAfter);

}
```

The `incrementCounter` function takes two arguments:
`list` - the `Array` (*of all our counters*)
and `index` - the counter that should be incremented.
So the returned value (`Array`) has the same count of items
but one of them is incremented.

Directly setting the value at the `index` *works* but this a mutation.
so if we add a `deepFreeze` call its *not* going to work *anymore*.

So *how* do we *replace* a single value in the array
 ***without mutating*** it?
 it turns out the *answer* is *really similar* to how we *remove* an item.

 ```js
incrementCounter = (list, index) => {
  return list
    .slice(0, index)
    .concat(list[index] + 1)
    .concat(list.slice(index + 1));
};
 ```

We want to take a slice *before* the `index`
and `concat` it with a single item `Array` with a *new* value
and then `concat` it with the *rest* of the original `Array`.

Finally with the **ES6** [***spread operator***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
we can spread over the left part of the `Array`
*specify* the *new* item,
and then *spread* over the right part of the *original* `Array`
and this *looks* much nicer ...

```js
incrementCounter = (list, index) => {
  return [
    ...list.slice(0, index),
    list[index] + 1,
    ...list.slice(index + 1)
  ];
};
```

In this lesson you learned how to use the `concat` method
*or* the *spread operator*
and the `slice` method to add, remove and change items in arrays
*without mutating* them
and how to *protect* yourself from *mutation* with `deepFreeze`
in your tests.

#### 10. Avoiding Object Mutations with Object.assign() and ...spread

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-avoiding-object-mutations-with-object-assign-and-spread

Like in the previous example I use `expect` and `deepFreeze` libraries
from NPM to make test assertions.
And this time I'm testing a function called `toggleTodo`
that takes a todo `Object` and *flips* its "*completed*" field.
So if `completed` was `false` it should be `true` in the returned value
or if it was `true` it should be `false`

```js
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {

};

const testToggleTodo = () => {
  const todoBefore = {
    id: 0,
    text: 'Learn Redux',
    completed: false
  }
  const todoAfter  = {
    id: 0,
    text: 'Learn Redux',
    completed: true
  }
  expect(
    toggleTodo(todoBefore)
  ).toEqual(todoAfter);
}

testToggleTodo(); // run the test

```

Just like in the last lesson, I'm going to start by writing
a *mutating* version that passes the current test.
So a *mutating* version just flips the `completed` field and re-assigns it on the passed `Object` (*the `todo`):

```js
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  todo.completed = !todo.completed;
  return todo;
}
```
And while it works,
we know that *mutations* are ***not allowed*** in Redux.
So to *enforce* this, I'm calling `deepFreeze` on my `todo` Object
(*in the case of the test `todoBefore`*)
and I'm *not allowed* to change its `completed` field anymore.

One way out of this would be to create a new object
with every field copied from the original object
*except* the `completed` field which would be flipped:

```js
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  return {
    id: todo.id,
    text: todo.text,
    completed: !todo.completed
  }
}
```

However if we later add new properties to the `todo` object,
we might *forget* to update this piece of code to include them.

This is why I suggest that you use the **ES6**
[`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
method which is *new* to **ES6**
and it lets you `assign` properties of *several* objects onto the target object. Note how the `Object.assign` order corresponds to that of the JavaScript assignment operator.
The left (*first*) argument is the one who's properties
are going to be assigned, so its going to be *mutated*.
This is why we are passing an *empty* `Object` as the *first* argument
so we don't *mutate* any *existing* data.
Every further argument to `Object.assign` will be considered a
"*source*" `Object` who's properties will be copied to the target object.

It is ***important*** that if several *sources* specify
different values for the *same* property, the ***last*** one "*wins*".
and this is what we use to *overwrite* the `completed` field
despite what the original object says.

```js
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  return Object.assign({}, todo, {
    completed: !todo.completed
  });
};
```

*Finally* you need to *remember* that
[`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
is a *new* method in **ES6** so it is *not natively available* in
all the Browsers (*specifically not supported in Internet Explorer*).

![object assign-browser-compatibility](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12080810/6fbc745c-b25f-11e5-9e58-ed860ea2872a.png)

You should use a "*polyfill*" either the one that ships with ***Babel***
or a *standalone* polyfill to use it (`Object.assign`) without risking
crashing your website.

Another option that does not require a polyfill is use
the new [`Object` ***spread*** operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
which is ***not part of ES6*** however it is *proposed* for **ES7**
it is "*fairly popular*" and it is *enabled* in Babel
if you use the "*stage 2 preset*":

```js
const toggleTodo = (todo) => {
  return {
    ...todo,
    completed: !todo.completed
  }
};
```

> **Note**: we have *not* used the `Object` spread operator in
our code because it does not run in *any* browser!!

#### 11. Writing a Todo List Reducer (Adding a Todo)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-writing-a-todo-list-reducer-adding-a-todo

Just like in the previous two lessons, I'm using the
**expect** library to make test assertions and
**deep-freeze** library to *prevent accidental mutations* in my code.

In this lesson I will create a reducer for a Todo-list application
who's state is described as an array of Todos.

Just to remind you what a reducer is: its a "*pure function*"
you write to implement the update logic of your application.
That is how the next state is calculated given the current state
and the action being dispatched.

Before writing a reducer I want a way of knowing whether its code is correct. So I'm starting by writing a test for it:


```js
const todos = (state = [], action) => {

};

const testAddTodo = () => {
  const stateBefore = [];
  const action = {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    id: 0,
    text: 'Learn Redux'
  }
  const stateAfter = [
    {
      id: 0,
      text: 'Learn Redux',
      completed: false
    }
  ];

  deepFreeze(stateBefore);
  deepFreeze(stateAfter);

  expect(
    todos(stateBefore, action);
  ).toEqual(stateAfter);
};

testAddTodo();

console.log('All tests passed.');
```

I'm declaring two variables:
+ `stateBefore` - the state before, which is an *empty* `Array`
+ `action` - the action being dispatched - which is an action describing a user adding a new todo with some `id` and a `text` (*fields*).

I am also declaring the *state* I `expect` *after* calling the reducer.
and like `stateBefore` it is an `Array`, but this time it has
a *single element* representing the Todo that was just added;
so it has the same `id` and `text` as the action `Object`.
and it *also* has an *additional* field called `completed`
that I want to be *initialized* to be `false`

We want to make sure that the reducer is a "*pure function*",
so I am calling `deepFreeze` both on the `stateBefore`
*and* the `action`.

*Finally* I'm ready to use the `expect` library to verify that if I call
the todo reducer with the `stateBefore` and the `action`
I'm going to get the result that is ***deeply*** **equal**
to the `stateAfter` I *just* declared.

This concludes my *first* test, now I can call it
just like a regular JavaScript function: `testAddTodo();`
And if it doesn't `throw` in the `expect` call I'm going to see a message
that the tests have passed.

Of *course* it fails because the reducer is not implemented yet;
it's an *empty* function, so it returns `undefined`
instead of the `Array` with a single item that I `expect` in the test.

To fix this I will need my reducer to take a look at the
`action.type` property which is a `String`
when it matches the `ADD_TODO` string which I specify in my test
to *satisfy* the test I need to return a *new* `Array`
which includes all the items from the *original* `Array`
but *also* a *new* Todo item that has its `id` and `text`
copied from the `action` Object
and a `completed` field set to `false`

Finally I add a `default` case to my `switch` statement
because *every* reducer has to `return` the *current* state
for any *unknown* `action`:

```js
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Now the tests run *successfully*!

Lets **recap** the *data flow* in this example to see why
first I create the state `Array` (`stateBefore`)
which is an *empty* `Array`
and the `action` Object inside my test function.
I'm passing them as arguments to my *reducer* function called todos
the `todos` reducer accepts the state and action as *arguments*
and takes a look at the `action.type`
in this case the `action.type` is a `String` saying `ADD_TODO`
so it matches the `switch` `case` inside the reducer
the reducer returns a *new* `Array`
which contains the items from the *old* `Array`
(*in the case of our test, the empty `stateBefore` Array*...)
and a *new* item (`Object`) representing the added todo
however the `state` we passed from the test was an *empty* `Array`
so at the end we are going to get an `Array` with a *single* item
which is the *new* todo
*finally* we compare the returned value
to an `Array` with a single todo item
to make sure the reducer works as intended
the equality check passes
so this makes the test successful.

#### 12. Writing a Todo List Reducer (Toggling a Todo)

This lesson picks up where we left off in Video 11,
so make sure you watched that an tried writing/running the code!

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-writing-a-todo-list-reducer-toggling-a-todo

In this lesson we will continue creating the reducer for the
todo list application
and the only action that this reducer *currently* handles
is called `ADD_TODO`
we also created a ***test*** that makes sure that when the reducer
is called with an *empty* `Array` and the `ADD_TODO` `action`
it returns an `Array` with a *single* todo element.

In this lesson we will follow the same approach
to implement another action called `toggleTodo`

We're going to start with the *test* again
and *this* time we are testing a different action
and we have a different *initial* `state`
the `state` *before* calling the reducer (`stateBefore`)
now includes two different todos with `id` `0` and `1`.
notice how *both* of them have their `completed` field set to `false`

Next I declare the `action`
and the action is as `Object` with the `type` property
wich is `TOGGLE_TODO` `String`
and the `id` of the todo that I want to be "*toggled*"
I declare the state that I `expect`
to receive *after* calling the reducer (`stateAfter`)
its pretty much the same as *before* calling the reducer
however I `expect` the todo with `id` specified in the `action`
or `1` in this case
to change its `completed` field

```js
const testToggleTodo = () => {
  const stateBefore = [
    {
      id: 0,
      text: 'Learn Redux',
      completed: false
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Go shopping',
    completed: false
  }
  ];
  const action = {
    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
    id: 1
  };
  const stateAfter = [
    {
      id: 0,
      text: 'Learn Redux',
      completed: false
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    text: 'Go shopping',
    completed: true
  }
  ];

  deepFreeze(stateBefore);
  deepFreeze(action);

  expect(
    todos(stateBefore, action)
  ).toEqual(stateAfter);
}

testToggleTodo();
console.log('All tests passed.')

```

the reducer *must* be a "*pure function*"
so at a matter of *precaution* I call `deepFreeze`
on the `state` and the `action`

*Finally*, just like in the previous lesson, I'm asserting
that the result of calling our reducer with the `stateBefore` and the `action`
is going to be "*deeply equal*" (`toEqual`) the `stateAfter`.

Now, my test is a function so I need to call it at the end of the file
And if I run it, it fails because I have not *implemented*
handling this action yet.

I'm adding a new `switch case` to my reducer
and I remember that I should not change the original `Array`
so I'm using the [`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method
to produce a *new* `Array`
the function I pass as an argument will be called for *every* todo
so if its *not* the todo I'm looking for, I don't want to change it,
so I just `return` it as is.
*However* if the todo *is* the one we want to toggle
I'm going to `return` a *new* `Object`
that *all* the properties of the *original* todo `Object`
thanks to the `Object` spread operator
but *also* an *inverted* value of the `completed` field:

```js
const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(todo => {
        if(todo.id !== action.id){
          return todo;
        }
        return {
          ...todo,
          completed: !todo.completed
        };
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

Now both of our tests run successfully...
And we have an implementation of the reducer that can add and toggle todos.

> ***Note***: While the [*spread operator*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Browser_compatibility)
is an **ES6** *Standard* for `Array`, its only a ***Draft*** for `Object`
proposed for **ES7** which means it is
**not** yet **available** in ***any*** **Browser**!
As such I have modified Dan's
code to use `Object.assign` (*see Video #10)
which (*at least*) works in Chrome...:

```js

case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
  return state.map(todo => {
    if(todo.id !== action.id){
      return todo;
    }
    return Object.assign({}, todo, {
      completed: !todo.completed
    });
  });
```

The *works* in ***ALL Modern Browsers Today (Without Babel)*** way of doing this is:
```js
case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
  return state.map(todo => {
    if(todo.id !== action.id){
      return todo;
    }
    var keys = Object.keys(todo); // IE9+
    var toggled = {};             // new object to avoid mutation
    keys.forEach(function(index) {
      toggled.index = todo.index; // copy all properties/values of todo
    });
    toggled.completed = !todo.completed
    return toggled;
  });

```

We can *probably* ***all*** agree that the code is more *elegant*
with the ES7 Object spread operator.
But in the interest of having something that works *now*
(*without Babel for running this tutorial in a Chrome without a node.js "workflow"...*)
I've opted to use the `Object.assign` method is an **ES6** *Standard*.

#### 13. Reducer Composition with Arrays

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-reducer-composition-with-arrays

In the *previous* lesson we created a *reducer*
that can handle two actions: adding a *new* todo
and toggling an *existing* todo.
Right now the code to *update* the todo item
or to *create* a new one is placed right inside the todos reducer
this function is hard [*difficult*] to understand
because it mixes two different concerns:
how the todos `Array` is updated *and*
how individual todos (`Objects`) are updated.
This is not a problem *unique* to Redux
any time a function does *too many* things
you want to *extract* other functions from it and call them
so that every function only addresses a single concern

In this case I decided that creating and updating a todo
in response to an `action` is a *separate* operation
and needs to be handled by a *separate* function called `todo`

```js
const todo = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      }
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      if (state.id !== action.id) {
        return state;
      }
      return Object.assign({}, state, { // see: https://git.io/vuBzV
        completed: !state.completed     // here state is the individual todo
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

const todos = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        todo(undefined, action)
      ];
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(t => todo(t, action));
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

As a matter of convention I decided that it should also accept
two arguments: the *current* `state` and the `action` being dispatched
and it should `return` the *next* `state`.
But in this case the `state` refers to the *individual* todo
and *not* to the *list* (`Array`) of todos.

*Finally* there is no "*magic*" in Redux to make it work.
We extracted the todo reducer from the todos reducer.
So now we need to call it for every todo
and assemble the results into an `Array`.
While this is not required in this particular example
I suggest that you *always* have the `default` case
where you `return` the *current* `state`
to avoid "*odd bugs*" in the future.

The ***Pattern*** described in this lesson
is *pervasive* in Redux development
and is called "[***Reducer Composition***](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)".

Different reducers specify how different parts of the `state` tree
are updated in response to different actions.
Reducers are also "*normal*" JavaScript functions
so they can call *other* reducers
to delegate and abstract away handling of updates
of some parts of the `state` they manage
this pattern can be applied *many* times
and while there is still a *single* top-level reducer
managing the `state` of your app
you will find it convenient
to express it as *many* reducers calling each other
each contributing to a *part* of the application `state` tree.


> Recap: this video/lesson was simply to show how
to extract a method from inside the *main* ("*top-level*")
reducer and have a *separate* reducer
which handles updates on the *individual* todo items.
> While there are ***more lines of code***,
> the *separate* reducers are ***more maintainable***

> Note that the tests from the *previous* video still pass
after we have created the `todo` reducer,
because the *functionality* has not changed,
its merely been separated to simplify the *main* reducer.

#### 14. Reducer Composition with Objects

Tip: This tutorial builds upon the code written in Video/Lesson 13.
If you skipped it, or left a break between watching the videos,
go back and re-acquaint yourself before proceeding.

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-reducer-composition-with-objects

In the *previous* lesson we established
the *pattern* of "*Reducer Composition"
where one reducer can be called by another reducer
to update items inside an array.
If we create a `store` with this reducer and log its `state`
we will find that the *initial* `state` of it
is an *empty* `Array` of todos
and if we *dispatch* an `ADD_TODO` `action`
we will find that the *corresponding* todo has been added
to the `state` `Array`
if we *dispatch* *another* `ADD_TODO` `action`
the *corresponding* todo will *also* be added at the end of the `Array`.
And dispatching a `TOGGLE_TODO` `action` with `id` (*set to*) `0`
will flip the `completed` field of the todo with `id` *zero* (`0`).

> The new code not in the previous tutorial is:

```js

const { createStore } =  Redux;
const store = createStore(todos);

console.log('Initial state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching ADD_TODO.'); // first todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: 0,
  text: 'Learn Redux'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching ADD_TODO.'); // second todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: 1,
  text: 'Go shopping'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');

console.log('Dispatching TOGGLE_TODO.'); // toggle first todo
store.dispatch({
  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
  id: 0
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');
```

(Code Snapshot for Video 14 @ 0:40)
> which has the following developer console *output*:

![learn-redux-output-of-video-14-console logs](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12122835/6dc1bc44-b3d5-11e5-8e4d-691bdd86f910.png)


Representing the *whole* `state` of the application
as an `Array` of todos works for a *simple* example
but what if we want to store *more* information?
For *example* we may want to let the user choose which todos
are *currently* *visible* with a `visibilityFilter`
such as `SHOW_COMPLETED`, `SHOW_ALL` or `SHOW_ACTIVE`.

```js
const visibilityFilter = (
  state = 'SHOW_ALL', // default state
  action
) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
      return action.filter;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

The `state` of the `visibilityFilter` is a *simple* `String`
representing the *current* filter
and it is *changed* by the `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` `action`.

```js
const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
  return {
    todos: todos(
      state.todos,
      action
    ),
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(
      state.visibilityFilter,
      action
    )
  };
};
```

To *store* this *new* information, I don't need to *change*
the *existing* reducers, I will use the Reducer Composition Pattern
and create a *new* reducer that *calls* the existing reducers
to manage parts of its state
and combines the results in a *single* `state` `Object`
***note*** that the first time it runs, it will pass `undefined` as the `state`
to the "*child*" reducers because the *initial* state
of the *combined* reducer is an *empty* `Object`
so all its fields are `undefined`
this gets the "*child*" reducers to return their *initial* `state`
and populates the `state` `Object` for the first time.

When an `action` comes in, it calls the reducers
with the parts of the `state` that they manage and the `action`
and combines the result into the *new* `State` object.
This is *another* example of the Reducer Composition Pattern
but this time we use it to *combine* *several* reducers
into a single reducer that we will now use to create our `store`.

The *initial* `state` of the *combined* reducer now contains
the *initial* `state` of the *independent* reducers
and any time an `action` comes in those reducers handle the action
*independently* this pattern helps *scale* Redux development
because different people on the team
can work on different reducers handling the *same* actions
without running into each other and causing merge conflicts.

```js
console.log('Dispatching SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER');
store.dispatch({
  type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
  filter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
});

console.log('Current state:');
console.log(store.getState());
console.log('--------------');
```

> Note: This `action` is merely setting the `visibilityFilter` *property*
of the `store` `Object`

> ***NOTE***: this code does not actually do anything
to the ***UI** *yet*. (*be patient that's next...*)

*Finally* I'm dispatching the `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` `action`
and you can see that it does not affect the todos
but the `visibilityFilter` field has been updated.

#### 15. Reducer Composition with `combineReducers`()

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-reducer-composition-with-combinereducers

In the previous lesson we learned how to use
the "*Reducer Composition*" Pattern
to let different reducers handle different parts of the `state` tree
and then *combine* their results.
In fact this pattern is *so* common
that it's present in *most* Redux applications.
And this is why Redux provides a function called `combineReducers`
that lets you avoid writing this code by *hand*
and instead it *generates* the top-level reducer *for* you.

The *only* argument to `combineReducers` is an `Object`
and this `Object` lets me specify the *mapping* between
the `state` field names and the reducers managing them:

```js
const { combineReducers } = Redux;
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  todos: todos,
  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter
});
```

The returned value of the `combineReducers` call is a reducer function
which is pretty much equivalent to
the reducer function I wrote by hand previously [*See: Video 14 above*]

The keys of the `Object` that I configure `combineReducers` with
correspond to the fields of the `state` `Object` its going to manage.

The *values* of the `Object` I pass to combine reducers are the reducers
it should call to update the corresponding `state` fields
this *combined* reducer call says that
the todos field inside the state object manages
will be updated by the `todos` reducer
and the `visibilityFilter` field inside the the `state` `Object`
will be will be updated by calling the `visibilityFilter` reducer
and the results will be assembled into a *single* `Object`
in other words it behaves pretty much exactly as the function
commented out below:

```js
// const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
//   return {
//     todos: todos(
//       state.todos,
//       action
//     ),
//     visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(
//       state.visibilityFilter,
//       action
//     )
//   };
// };
```

*Finally* I will establish a *useful* convention:
I will *always* name my reducers after the `state` keys they manage
since the *key* names and the *value* names are now the *same*
I can *omit* the *values* thanks to the **ES6** Object Literal
***Shorthand Notation***:

```js
const { combineReducers } = Redux;
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  todos,
  visibilityFilter
});
```

In this lesson you learned how to *generate* a single reducer
that calls many reducers to manage parts of its state
by using the `combineReducers` utility function.

#### 16. Implementing combineReducers() from Scratch

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-implementing-combinereducers-from-scratch

In the previous lesson we learned to use the `combineReducers` function
which comes with Redux and generates one reducer
from several other reducers
delegating to them parts of the `state` tree.

To gain a *deeper* understanding of how *exactly* `combineReducers` works
we will *implement* it ***from scratch*** in this lesson.

`combineReducers` is a function so I'm writing a function declaration
and its only argument is the *mapping* between `state` keys
and the reducers, so I'm just going to call it `reducers`.

```js
// const { combineReducers } = Redux;
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
  return (state = {}, action) => {
    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
      (nextState, key) => {
        nextState[key] = reducers[key](
          state[key],
          action
        );
        return nextState;
      },
      {} // empty initial nextState
    );
  };
};
```

The returned value is supposed to be a reducer itself
so this is a function that returns another function
and the signature of the returned function is a reducer signature
it has the `state` and the `action`
now I'm calling the [`Object.keys` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) (*IE9+*)
which gives me all the `keys` of the `reducers` `Object`
in our example this is `todos` and `visibilityFilter`
next I am calling the (Array) `reduce` method on the `keys`
because I want to produce a *single* value such as the `nextState`
by *accumulating* over every reducer `key`
and calling the *corresponding* reducer
each reducer passed to the combined reducers function is only responsible
for updating a *part* of the `state`
this is why I'm saying that the `nextState` by the given `key`
can be calculated by calling
the *corresponding* reducer by the *given* `key` with
the *current* `state` by the *given* `key`
and the `action`
the `Array.reduce` wants me to `return` the *next* accumulated value
from the callback so I am returning the `nextState`
and I'm also specifying an *empty* `Object` as the *initial* `nextState`
*before* all the `keys` are processed.
And there we have it this is a *working* re-implementation of
`combineReducers` utility from Redux

Lets briefly *recap* how it works.
I'm calling `combineReducers` with an `Object`
who's values are the reducer functions
and keys are the `state` fields they manage
inside the *generated* reducer I'm retrieving all the keys
of the reducers I passed to `combineReducers` which is
an `Array` of `Strings` (*specifically*)
`todos` and `visibilityFilter` (*in our example*).
I'm starting with an *empty* `Object` for my `nextState`
and I'm using the `Reduce` operation over these `keys`
to fill it *gradually*.
Notice that I am *mutating* the `nextState` `Object` on every iteration
this is not a problem because it is an `Object` I created
*inside* the reducer it is not something passed from *outside*
so reducer stays a "*pure*" function.
To calculate the `nextState` for a given `key`
it calls the corresponding reducer function
such as `todos` or `visibilityFilter`
the *generated* reducer will pass to the *child* reducer
only a *part* of its `state` by the `key`
so if its `state` is a *single* `Object`
its only going to pass the *relevant* part
such as `todos` or `visibilityFilter`
depending on the *current* `key`
and save the result in the `nextState` by the same `key`

*Finally* we use the `Array.reduce` operation (*method*)
with the *empty* `Object` as the *initial* `nextState`
that is being filled on every iteration
until it is the return value of the whole `.reduce` operation

In this lesson you learned how to implement the `combineReducers`
utility that comes with Redux from *scratch*
it is not *essential* to use in Redux
so it is *fine* if you don't fully understand how it works *yet*
however it is a *good* [*great*!] idea to
*practice* functional programming
and *understand* that functions can take other functions
and `return` other functions
because knowing this will help you get more productive in Redux
in the long term.

#### 17. React Todo List Example (Adding a Todo)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-react-todo-list-example-adding-a-todo

In the *previous* lesson we learned how to split the "*root*" reducer
into *many* smaller reducers that manage *parts* of the `state` tree
and now we have a ready `todoApp` reducer
that handles all the `actions` of our simple todo application.

So now it's time to *implement* the ***view layer***
and I'm going to use React in this example

I'm adding **React** and [React-DOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html) packages from the Facebook CDN
and I'm also adding a div with `id='root'`
which is where I'm going to `render` my React application

```js
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.5/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/0.14.5/react-dom.min.js"></script>
```

Similar to the React *Counter* example from the 8<sup>th</sup> Lesson
I declare a `render` function that is going to update the DOM
in response to the *current* application `state`
and I'm going to `subscribe` to the `store` changes
and call `render` when ever the `store` changes
and *once* to `render` the *initial* state:

```js
const { createStore } =  Redux;
const store = createStore(todoApp);

const render = () => {
  // gets expanded below ...
};

store.subscribe(render);
render();
```

And the *implementation* of the `render` method
is going to use React so its calling `ReactDOM.render`
for some `TodoApp` *component* I haven't written *yet*
and it renders it into the `div` I created inside the `html`
called `root`.

React provides a "*base*" `Class` for all components
so I'm grabbing it from the React `Object`
its called `React.Component`
and I'm declaring my own `TodoApp` component
that `extends` the React "*base*" `Component`

```js
const { Component } = React;

class TodoAPP extends Component {
// filled out below ...
}

const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <TodoApp />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
};
```

This `Component` is only going to have a `render` function
and is going to return a `<div>`
and *inside* the `<div>` I'm going to place a `<button>` saying "Add Todo"
but I don't want to add an `input` field *yet* to keep the example *simple*
at first so I'm dispatching the `ADD_TODO` `action`
and I'm going to put `Test` as my `text` for the `action`
so it's going to keep adding todos with the `text` "Test".
and the `id` I need to specify a sequential `id`
so this is why I'm declaring a *global* variable called `nextTodoId`
and I'm going to keep incrementing it.
so every time its going to emit (*dispatch an `action` with*) a *new* `id`
and *finally* I also want to display a *list* of the todos
so, *assuming* that I have the todos injected as a `todos` prop
I will call `.map` and for every `todo` item I'm going to show a `<li>`
showing the text of that particular todo.

*Finally* because I need the `todos` as a `prop`
I'm going to pass it to the `TodoApp`
by reading the the *current* `store` `state`
and reading its `todos` field:

```js
const { Component } = React;

let nextTodoId = 0;

class TodoApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => {
          store.dispatch({
            type: 'ADD_TODO',
            text: 'Test',
            id: nextTodoId++
          });
        }}>
          Add Todo
        </button>
        <ul>
          {this.props.todos.map(todo =>
            <li key={todo.id}>
              {todo.text}
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <TodoApp todos={store.getState().todos} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
};
```

If you open the file in your browser, you should expect to see:

![learn-redux-video-17-example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12147411/a1bb3974-b490-11e5-8ab0-b011dfecc959.png)


You can see that there is a `<button>` "Add todo"
and any time I press it I see a *new* todo with the "Test" `text`.

Now I'm going to add an `input` inside my render function
and I'm using the React callback `ref` API where `ref` is a function
it gets the `node` corresponding to the `ref`
and I'm saving that `node` in this case `this.input`
so I'm able to *read* the `value` of the `input`
inside my event handler, I'm reading `this.input.value`
and I'm also able to *reset* that value
*after* dispatching the `action` so that the field is cleared.

Now if I try to write something in the `input` field and press "Add Todo"
the `ADD_TODO` `action` is dispatched and the field is *cleared*.

Lets take a moment to recap how this application works.

It starts with the TodoApp React Component
and this Component is not aware *exactly* how todos are being added
however it can express its desire to mutate the `state`
by dispatching an `action` with the `type` `ADD_TODO`
for the `text` field it uses the *current* `input` value (`this.input.value`)
and it passes an *incrementing* `id` as the `id` of todo
every todo needs its own `id` and in this approach we are just going
to increment the counter so it always gives us the next integer as `id`
it is common for React Components to dispatch `actions` in Redux apps
however it is *equally* important to be able to `render` the *current* `state`
my `TodoApp` Component assumes that it is going to receive todos
as a `prop` and it *maps* over the todos to display a *list* of them.
using the `id` as a `key`.
This Component is being rendered in the `render` function
that runs any time the `store` `state` changes, and *initially*.
The `render` function reads the *current* `state` of the `store`
and passes the todos `Array` that it gets
from the *current* `state` of the `store`
to the `TodoApp` Component as a `prop`
the `render` function is called on every `store` change
so the `todos` prop is always up-to-date
this was the *rendering* part of the Redux flow.

Lets recap how *mutations* work in Redux:
any `state` change is caused by a `store.dispatch`
call somewhere in the Component.
When an `action` is dispatched
the `store` calls the *reducer* it was created with
with the *current* `state` and the `action` being dispatched
and in our case, this is the `todoApp` reducer
which we obtained by combining the `visibilityFilter` and the `todos` reducer.
It matches the `action` `type` in a `switch` statement
and if the `action` `type` is `ADD_TODO`
and indeed it is equal to `ADD_TODO` `String`
in this case it will call the "*child*" `todo` reducer,
passing it `undefined` because there is no `state` for a *new* todo
and the `action`.
We have a *similar* `switch` statement inside the `todo` reducer
and the `action` `type` is `ADD_TODO` which returns the
*initial* `state` of the todo with the `id` and `text` from the `action`
and `completed` field set to `false`
the todos reducer that *called* it will return
a *new* `Array` with all *existing* items
and the *new* item added at the very end as a *new* todo
to the *current* `state`

*Finally* the combined reducer called `todoApp`
will use this *new* `Array` as the new value for the todos field
in the *global* `state` `Object`
so its going to return a *new* `state` `Object`
where the todos field corresponds to the `Array`
with the newly added Todo item.
The `todoApp` reducer is the "*root*" reducer in this application
it is the one the `store` was created with.
so its next state is the *next* `state` of the Redux `store`
and all the *listeners* are notified
the `render` function is *subscribed* to the `store` changes
so it is called *again* and it gets the *fresh* `state`
by calling `getState` and it passes the *fresh* todos to the Component
re-rending it with the *new* data.

#### 18. React Todo List Example (Toggling a Todo)

> https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-react-todo-list-example-toggling-a-todo

In the last lesson we implemented a simple UI for the Todo List application
that is able to add *new* todos and view the *existing* todos in a list
to *add* the todos we dispatched the `ADD_TODO` `action`
and in *this* lesson we are going to the `TOGGLE_TODO` `action`
to *toggle* the *completed* `state` of the todos by clicking on them.

I'm scrolling down to my React Component and I've got a `<li>` here
corresponding to the todo so I'm adding the `onClick` handler
so when the user clicks on the list item I want to dispatch an `action`
to my `store` with the `type` `TOGGLE_TODO` and the `id`
of the todo being *toggled* which I get from the todo `Object`

The event handler *knows* which todo it corresponds to so it is able
to pass its `id` in the `action`.
In the user interface I want the completed todos to appear crossed out.
so I'm adding the `style` attribute to the `<li>`
and I'm going to use the `textDecoration` property
which is going to be "line-through" (*strike-through*)
when `completed` is `true` and *none* when `todo.compleded` is `false`
so I get a "normal" looking todo.
And now if I add a couple of todos
I can click on them and they are going to appear toggled:

```js
<ul>
  {this.props.todos.map(todo =>
    <li key={todo.id}
     onClick={() => {
      store.dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
        id: todo.id
      });
     }}
     style={{
      textDecoration:
        todo.completed ?
          'line-through' :
          'none'
     }}
     >
      {todo.text}
    </li>
  )}
</ul>
```

When you run it (*in Google Chrome Canary*) you should expect to see:

![video-18-at-1min25sec-screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/12149808/a7565b22-b49d-11e5-87b5-a66dec698686.png)

... And I can *toggle* them back. Isn't that *satisfying*...?

Lets recap how *toggling* the todo actually *works*.
it starts with me dispatching the `TOGGLE_TODO` `action`
inside my `onClick` handler with the `type` `TOGGLE_TODO`
and the `id` which is the `id` of the todo being rendered
I get the `todo` `Object` as an *argument* to the `Array.map` callback
inside my `render` method where I render all the todos
when an `action` is dispatched the `store` will call the "*root*" reducer
which will call the todos reducer with the `Array` of todos
and the `action` and in *this* case the `action` `type` is `TOGGLE_TODO`
so the todos reducer delegates the handling of *every* todo
to the `todo` reducer with a `.map` function to call it for *every* todo item.
 So the `todo` reducer receives the todo as `state` and the `action`
again we `switch` on the `action.type` and it matches `TOGGLE_TODO` `String`
and now for *every* todo who's `id` does not match the `id` specified
in the `action` we just `return` the *previous* `state`
that is the todo `Object` as it was
*however* if the `id` of the todo matches
the one *specified* in the `action`
we are going to `return` a *new* `Object`
with all the properties of the *original* todo
but with the `completed` field equal to
the *opposite* value of what it was;
e.g: `completed: !state.completed`

The updated todo item will be will be included in the todos field
under the *new* application `state`
and because we `subscribe` the `render` function
its going to get the *next* `state` of the application
in `store.getState()`
and pass the *new* version of the todos to the `TodoApp` Component.
Which is going to render the *updated* todos.

*Finally* the (CSS) `style` of the `<li>`
depends on the `todo.completed` field which we just updated
which is why it re-renders in a crossed-out `state`.

#### 19. React Todo List Example (Filtering Todos)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-react-todo-list-example-filtering-todos

In the previous two lessons we were working on creating the user-interface
for the Todo List Application that displays the todos
lets us add new todos and "toggle" them `onClick`
we *implemented* that by dispatching `ADD_TODO`
and `TOGGLE_TODO` `actions`
that we already know how to handle in our reducers.

In *this* lesson we are going to dispatch `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` `action`
and use the `visibilityFilter` *field*
to *only* show the todos the *user* wants to see;
either the *completed* todos, *active* todos
or *all* the todos in the *current* `state`.

I'm starting by creating a *new* Component,
a *functional* Component called `FilterLink`
that user needs to click to switch the *current* visible todos.
and the `FilterLink` accepts `filter` prop which is just a `String`
and the `children` which is the content of the link.
and its going to be a simple `<a>` ("*anchor*") tag
that doesn't really *link* anywhere,
its going to `prevent` the navigation when clicked
and its going to dispatch and `action`
with a `type` `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER`
and passing the `filter` prop
so that the reducer knows which filter is being clicked.
I will pass the `children` down to the `<a>` tag
so the "consumer" can specify the `text` of the link
Now I can use it in my `TodoApp` Component.

Just below the todo list I'm adding a paragraph
where I'm going to offer the user the choice
as to which todos should be *currently* visible
by using the `FilterLink` Component I just created.
The `filter` prop is one of these possible values
such as `SHOW_ALL` which corresponds
to showing *every* todo in the `state`
`SHOW_ACTIVE` which means just show the todos
that are *not* completed yet,
and `SHOW_COMPLETED` which means show the *completed* todos.

```js
<p>
  Show:
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_ALL'
  >
  All
  </FilterLink>
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_ACTIVE'
  >
  Active
  </FilterLink>
  {' '}
  <FilterLink
    filter='SHOW_COMPLETED'
  >
  Completed
  </FilterLink>
</p>
```

So I'm *copy-pasting* the `FilterLink`
and I'm changing the labels
and the filters corresponding to it
running this code will give me 3 different things
under the list of todos.
Clicking on them will change the `state.visibilityFilter` field
*however* it doesn't have *any* effect yet.
because we don't interpret the value of the `visibilityFilter`


I'm creating a *new* function
that is going to help me filter the todos according to the
the filter value, its called `getVisibleTodos`
it accepts two arguments: the `todos` and the `filter`
and it *switches* on the *current* `filter` value
so if the `filter` is `SHOW_ALL`
its going to `return` all of the todos
but if the `filter` is `SHOW_COMPLETED`
its going to call `todos.filter()`
(*that is the `Array.filter` method*)
to only return those todos that have `completed` set to `true`
and `SHOW_ACTIVE` is going to be the *opposite* of that
its going to `return` *only* those todos that
where `completed` field is `false`.

```js
const getVisibleTodos = (
  todos,
  filter
) => {
  switch (filter) {
    case 'SHOW_ALL':
      return todos;
    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
      return todos.filter(
        t => t.completed
      );
    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
      return todos.filter(
        t => !t.completed
      );
  }
}
```

Now I need to *call* this function
to `filter` the todos *before* rendering them
so in the `render` function of the `TodoApp` Component
I get the `visibleTodos` by calling the `getVisibleTodos`
with the `todos` and the `visibilityFilter` *values* from my props
and I'm going to *use* the `visibleTodos` *instead* of
`this.props.todos` when I enumerate them for rendering.

*Finally* I now use the `visibilityFilter` inside my `TodoApp` Component
so I need to pass it as a prop
and I can do this *explicitly*
but its *easier* just to "spread" over *all* the `state` fields
so *every* property of the `state` `Object` is passed
as a prop to the `TodoApp` Component
this way it receives the `visibilityFilter`
and if I *add* some todo items and then click on them
so I change their `completed` fields
and then click on the `visibilityFilter` links
the *currently* visible todos are rendered according
to the *chosen* `visibilityFilter`.

The links look all the same right now
but we want to highlight the *chosen* one.
To *implement* this, we're going to need the `visibilityFilter` prop
which says which is the *current* one.
I'm changing the *beginning* of the `render` method
to "*destructure*" the `todos` and `visibilityFilter` from the props
so I can access them *directly* without typing `this.props` every time.

> ***NOTE***: [**ES6** ***Destructuring assignment***](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
is ***not supported*** in Chrome yet, so I'm not using this in the code example.
> so Instead of:

```js
const {
  todos,
  visibilityFilter
} = this.props; // destructuring assignment
```

I'm using:

```js
const todos = this.props.tods, visibilityFilter = this.props.visibilityFilter
```

and I'm going to pass the `visibilityFilter` to every `FilterLink`
so it can *know* which `filter` is the *current* one
and *apply* different styling
if the `currentFilter` matches the `FilterLink`'s *own* filter.

After passing the `currentFilter` prop to every `FilterLink`
I go back to the `FilterLink` declaration and I'm adding
`currentFilter` as a prop to it and I'm adding a *condition*
that says that when the `filter` is the `currentFilter`
that is when the link is *active*
I want to `return` a `<span>` instead of a link
because I don't want it to be *clickable*,
I want it to be *static* text
this completes the user-interface of our Todo List example
it lets us *add* items, it lets us *view* items,
toggle them as *completed*
and when we `switch` the `visibilityFilter`
it displays only *relevant* todos
and it *also* updates the link *appearance*
so we see which link is *active*.

Lets recap how changing the `visibilityFilter` *works*
it starts with a dispatch call with an `action`
of the `type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'`
and it passes `filter` which is a prop to the `FilterLink` Component
so every one of those 3 links is going to have a different `filter` prop
it passes in the `action`.
The `store.dispatch` function will call our *root* reducer with
the `state` and the `action` which in turn
will call the `visibilityFilter` reducer
with the *part* of the `state` and the `action`.
Note that when the `action.type` is `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER`
it doesn't *care* for the *previous* `state`
it just returns the `action.filter` as the *next* value,
the next `state` of the `visibilityFilter` reducer
the root reducer will *use* this new field as part of its *new*
`state` `Object` and because the `render` function is
*subscribed* to the `store` changes ( `store.subscribe(render);` )
its going to get this *new* `state` `Object`
and pass all its keys as props to the `TodoApp` Component
so the `TodoApp` Component will receive the todos
and the *updated* `visibilityFilter` as its props
both its props are passed to the `getVisibleTodos` function
which calculates the *currently* `visibleTodos`
according to a list of *all* `todos` and the `visibilityFilter`
and the `filter` is just a `String` saying
`SHOW_ALL`, `SHOW_COMPLETED` or `SHOW_ACTIVE`
and the returned value is a *new* `Array` of todos
that in some cases filters them and in some cases returns as is
and the `SHOW_COMPLETED` and `SHOW_ACTIVE` are
only different in their *predicates*.

The `return` value is the `Array` of `visibleTodos` and it is used
in the `render` function to actually enumerate every `todo`
and *render* it
and the `visibilityFilter` field is also used by the `FilterLink`
as the `currentFilter` because the `FilterLink` wants to know
whether its `filter` is the *current* one
in order to `render` a `<span>` instead of a link (`<a>` tag).
This is how clicking a link makes it appear selected
and changes the *currently* displayed items in the list.

#### 20. Extracting Presentational Components (Todo, TodoList)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-presentational-components-todo-todolist

In the last few lessons we created the user interface for a simple
React and Redux Todo List where I can add items, toggle them
as completed and change the *currently* visible Todos
and we do that by having a *single* `TodoApp` Component
that the `<input>`, the `<button>` for *adding* todos
the *list* of *currently* visible todos with `onClick` handler
and it has these 3 links that let us change
the *currently* visible todos.
The *single* Component approach worked so far,
however we really want to have *many* components
that can be used tested and changed by different people separately
so we are going to re-factor our application in this lesson.

The first Component I want to *extract* from the `TodoApp` Component
is the `Todo` Component that renders a *single* `<li>`
I'm declaring the `Todo` Component as a function
which React 0.14 allows me to do.
I'm not *sure* which props its going to have
so I will leave them blank for now
and I will just *paste* the `<li>` I copied before.

The first thing I am doing is *removing* the special `key` property
because it's only needed when I am enumerating an `Array`
and I will use it *later* when enumerating *many* todos.
One of my goals with this refactoring is to make every Component
as flexible as it is *reasonable*.
Right now I have *hard-coded* that *clicking* a todo always
causes the `TOGGLE_TODO` `action`
and this is perfectly fine to do in your app
however I prefer to have a bunch of Components
that don't specify any *behaviors*
and that are *only* concerned with how things *look*
or how they `render` and I call such Components
the "*presentational*" Components
I would like to keep `Todo` a "*Presentational*" Component
so I *remove* the `onClick` handler and I promote it to be a prop
so that anyone who uses the `Todo` Component
can specify what happens on the *click*
and you don't *have* to do this in your Redux apps
but I find it to be a very *convenient* pattern.
*Finally* while it does not make a lot of difference,
I prefer to keep it explicit what is the `data`
that the Component needs to `render`
so instead of passing a `todo` `Object`
I pass `completed` and `text` fields as *separate* props.
note: how the `Todo` Component
is now a *purely* "*Presentational*" Component
and does not specify *any* behavior
but it *knows* how to `render` a todo.

```js
const Todo = ({
  onClick,
  completed,
  text
}) => (
<li
  onClick={onClick}
  style={{
  textDecoration:
    completed ?
      'line-through' :
      'none'
  }}
 >
  {text}
</li>
);
```

The *next* Component I create is called `TodoList`
and it's *also* a "*Presentational*" Component
its *only* concerned with how things *look*
and it accepts an `Array` of todos
and is going to `render` an `<ul>` (*unordered list*) of them
by calling the todos `map` function (`Array.map`)
and rendering a Todo component for every todo.
it tells React to use `todo.id` as the unique `key` for the elements
and it *spreads* over the `todo` `Object` properties
so that `text` and `completed` end up as props on `Todo` Component
now I need to *specify* what happens when a `Todo` is clicked
and I *could* have dispatched an `action` here
and again, that would be *fine*
but I want it to be a "*Presentational*" Component
so I'm going to call *another* function
called `onTodoClick` and pass the `id` of the `todo`
and let it decide what should happen
so `onTodoClick` is another prop for the `TodoList`
both `Todo` and `TodoList` are "*Presentational*" Components
so we need something I call "*Container*" Components
to actually pass the data from the `store`
and to specify the behavior

```js
const TodoList = ({
  todos,
  onTodoClick
}) => (
  <ul>
    {todos.map(todo =>
      <Todo
        key={todo.id}
        {...todo}
        onClick={() => onTodoClick(todo.id)}
      />
    )}
  </ul>
```

In this case the top-level `TodoApp` Component
acts as a "*Container*" Components
and we will see more examples of "*Container*" Components
in the future lessons.
In this case you just render the `TodoList` with `visibleTodos`
as the `todos` and with a callback that says
that when `onTodoClick` is called with a `todo.id`
we should dispatch an `action` on the `store`
with the `type` `TOGGLE_TODO` and the `id` of the `todo`.

```js
<TodoList
  todos={visibleTodos}
  onTodoClick={id =>
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
      id
    })
  } />
```

Let's recap again how this works:
The `TodoApp` Component renders a `TodoList`
and it passes a function to it
that can dispatch an `action`
the `TodoList` Component renders the `Todo` Component
and passes `onClick` prop which calls `onTodoClick`
the `Todo` Component uses the `onClick` prop it receives
and binds it to the `<li>` `onClick`
this way when its called the `onTodoClick` is called
and this dispatches the `action` and updates the `visibleTodos`
because the `action` updates the `store`.

<br />

#### 21. Extracting Presentational Components (AddTodo, Footer, FilterLink)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-presentational-components-addtodo-footer-filterlink

In the previous lesson I extracted the `Todo` and `TodoList`
Components from the `TodoApp` Component.
In this lesson I will continue extracting
other "*Presentational*" Components to separate the *looks*
from the *behavior*.
Now I want to extract the `<input>` and the `<button>`
into a separate Component called `AddTodo`.
I'm declaring `AddTodo` as a "*Functional* Component"
that does not accept any props
and I'm going to `return` these
*cut-pasted*  `<input>` and `<button>`
but I'm wrapping them in a `<div>` because
a (React) Component needs to have a *single* root element.

```js
const AddTodo = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={node => {
        this.input = node;
      }} />
      <button onClick={() => {
        store.dispatch({
          type: 'ADD_TODO',
          text: this.input.value,
          id: nextTodoId++
        });
        this.input.value = '';
      }}>
        Add Todo
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The *Functional* Components don't have instances
however instead of using `this`,
I can use a *local* variable called `input`
that I'm going to "*close over*" so that I can write to it
in the callback ref and I can read from it in the event handler.
Like previously I want it to be a "*Presentational*" Component
and not specify behavior
so I'm just calling a function called `onAddClick`
passing the *current* `input` value and I make `onAddClick` a prop
so that the Component that *uses* `AddTodo`
can specify what happens when `Add` button is clicked.

Again, the `TodoApp` Component acts as a "*Container*" Component
for the `AddTodo` and it specifies that when the *add* `<button>`
is clicked we should dispatch an action with the `type: 'ADD_TODO'`
the corresponding `text` and the `nextTodoId`.

The *last* Component I want to extract is the *footer* which contains
all these three `FilterLink`.
I'm creating a *new* "*Functional*" Component called `footer`
and I'm not sure which props it needs so I skip them
and I *paste* the markup.
It seems that the `FilterLink` need the `visbilityFilter`
so I add it as a prop.
I would like the `Footer` and the `FilterLink` to be
"*Presentational*" Components
however the `FilterLink` currently includes a `store.dispatch` call.
I'm replacing it with an `onClick` call
and I pass the `filter` as the single parameter
for the calling Component's convenience
I add `onClick` to the props and now I need to specify it
every time `FilterLink` is used
so I add `onFilterClick` to the `Footer`
and I pass `onClick={onFilterClick}` for every link in the `Footer`
so what ever we pass to the `Footer` as `onFilterClick` prop is
going to end up in the `FilterLink` as `onClick`.

```js
const Footer = ({
  visibilityFilter,
  onFilterClick
}) => (
  <p>
    Show:
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_ALL'
      currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
      onClick={onFilterClick}
    >
    All
    </FilterLink>
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_ACTIVE'
      currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
      onClick={onFilterClick}
    >
    Active
    </FilterLink>
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_COMPLETED'
      currentFilter={visibilityFilter}
      onClick={onFilterClick}
    >
    Completed
    </FilterLink>
  </p>
);
```


Now I can use the `Footer` Component I just defined
inside my `TodoApp` Component
and I need to pass *two* props
one of them is the `visibilityFilter` so it can highlight the *active* link
and another prop is `onFilterClick` where I say that
whenever a `Filter` is clicked I want to dispatch an `action`
with the `type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'` and the `filter` being clicked.

```js
// inside the TodoApp Component:

  <Footer
    visibilityFilter={visibilityFilter}
    onFilterClick={filter =>
      store.dispatch({
        type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
        filter
      })
    }
  />

// see index.html for full TodoApp
```

*Finally* I just noticed that the `TodoApp` Component doesn't actually
*have* to be a `Class`, I can turn it into a `function`
and I prefer to do that when possible.
Instead of `destructuring` the props inside the `render` method
I am now doing it inside the arguments.
I can remove now the `destructuring` and I can also remove
the `render` method declaration
the `visibleTodos` are only used in a *single* place
so I'm moving the `getVisibleTodos` call
to the `TodoList` `todos` prop declaration.

Now the body of my function is just a *single* expression
so I can get rid of the `return` statement
and *un-indent* the code to make it look nicer.

> *This version of `TodoApp` is *so* ***much cleaner***... **IMO**.

This concludes the *initial* refactoring of the Todo List Application
into a single "*Container*" Component called `TodoApp`
and many "*Presentational*" Components that are
only concerned with how things *look*.

Lets re-cap the *data* flow in this example:
We have a *single* "*Container*" Component called `TodoApp`
and we re-render it any time the `store` changes
it receives the `keys` of the *global* `state` `Object` as the props
so it receives the `todos` and the `visibilityFilter` values
the *first* Component it renders is called `AddTodo`.
`AddTodo` is a "*Presentational*" Component that
renders an `<input>` and a `<button>`
and when the `<button>` is *clicked* it passes the *current* `<input>` value
to the `onAddClick` function.
`onAddClick` function is a prop for the `AddTodo` Component
in this case it is *specified* by the `TodoApp`
which says that when the `<button>` is clicked it should dispatch an `action`
containing the *current* `text` in the `action` `Object`.
Dispatching the `ADD_TODO` `action` will call our reducer
update the `store` `state` with the new todos
and re-render the `TodoApp` Component with the new todos.
The todos themselves are rendered by the `TodoList`
"*Presentational*" Component that receives two props:
the *currently* visible todos and the `onTodoClick` callback
the `TodoList` Component receives an `Array` of todos
and it *maps* over them rendering individual `Todo` Components
it uses the *spread* operator to pass every property of the todo `Object`
as a prop to `Todo` Component
and it specifies the `onClick` handler as calling `onTodoClick`
with the `id` of the particular todo
the `Todo` Component is defined above
and it is also a "*Presentational*" Component
so it doesn't specify the behavior
it says that when a `<li>` is *clicked*
it should call the `onClick` handler
being a "*Presentational*" Component it specifies how the Component *looks*
in different circumstances
and in this case it uses the `completed` prop
to chose between two different styles of the todo item
the `TodoList` is also a "*Presentational*" Component
so it delegates actually *handling* the *click* to `onTodoClick` prop
and it pass the `id` of the todo being *clicked*.

*Finally* the `TodoApp` reacts to it by dispatching an `action`
containing the `id` of the todo clicked and the `type: 'TOGGLE_TODO'`
the `store` will call our reducer and update the `state` of the application
re-rendering the `TodoApp` Component with the *new* todos.

The `Footer` Component receives the *current* `visibilityFilter` as a prop
and also receives the `onFilterClick` callback that sets
the *current* `visibilityFilter`.
The `Footer` Component renders *three* `FilterLink`
passing down their respective `filter` values
the `onClick` handler and the *current* `visibilityFilter`
the `FilterLink` Component being a "*Presentational*" Component
doesn't know *what* to do when it is *clicked*.
so it calls the `onClick` callback passing the `filter`
which is different for each of those links as an *argument*
the `Footer` delegates handling the *click* of the `FilterLink`
to its own prop called `onFilterClick`.

*Finally* the `TodoApp` Component being the "*Container*" Component
in our application specifies the *behavior*
which in this case means that when the `FilterLink` is *clicked*
it should dispatch and `action` with the `action`
`type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` and the *new* `filter`.

Separation of the "*Presentational*" Components is *not required* in Redux.
But I *recommend* this pattern because it de-couples your rendering from Redux. So if you later chose to move your project to another framework
such as Relay you will not have to *change* all your components
because you can keep all your "*Presentational*" Component exactly the same.

This approach also has *downsides* such as that you have to
thread a lot of props through the Components to get them
to the "*leaf*" Components including the callbacks
this problem can be *easily* solved by introducing
many intermediate "*Container*" Components as we will see in the next lesson.

#### 22. Extracting Container Components (FilterLink)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-container-components-filterlink

In the previous lesson we separated the "*Presentational*" Components
from the the main "*Container*" Component
the `TodoApp` specifies the *behaviors*
such as what happens when the **Add** `<button>` is clicked
how the todos are selected
what happens when a *single* `Todo` has been clicked
and what happens when a `Footer` Link is clicked.
And the components such as `AddTodo`, the `TodoList`, the `Todo` itself
the `Footer` and the `FilterLink` they don't dispatch actions
they call their callbacks [passed] in the props
so they are *only* responsible for the *looks* but not for the behavior.
The downside of this approach is that
I have to pass a lot of props down the "tree"
even when the *intermediate* Components don't really *use* them
for example: the `FilterLink` needs to know the `currentFilter`
so that it can chose a different appearance when it is *active*
however, in order to *receive* the `currentFilter` it has to be passed down
from the top, so this is why the `Footer` has to accept `visibilityFilter`
as a prop so it can pass it down as a `currentFilter` to the `FilterLink`.

In a way this *breaks* encapsulation
because the "*Parent*" Components need to *know* too much
about what data the *Child* Components need
so to solve this we are going to *extract* a few more "*Container*" Components
just like we extracted the "*Presentational*" Components in the previous lesson.

The *first* Component I'm going to re-factor is the `Footer` Component
and *currently* it accepts two props the `visibilityFilter`
and the `onFilterClick` callback,
but it doesn't actually *use* either of them,
it just passes them down to the `Filterlink`
so this seems like a *good* opportunity for *simplification*.
We can only do this because we *know* that the `Footer` Component
doesn't *care* about the values of these props
they only exist to be passed down to the `Filterlink`
that cares about them.

```js
const Footer = () => (
  <p>
    Show:
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_ALL'
    >
    All
    </FilterLink>
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_ACTIVE'
    >
    Active
    </FilterLink>
    {' '}
    <FilterLink
      filter='SHOW_COMPLETED'
    >
    Completed
    </FilterLink>
  </p>
);
```

I'm removing the props definition
and I'm removing these props from the `FilterLink` usage
and it might start to seem a lot like the code *before*
separating the "*Presentational*" Components
however what I want to do here is a little bit different.

The `FilterLink` does not *currently* specify the behavior
for clicking on the link
it also needs the `currentFilter`
to tell whether it should be rendered as *active*
therefore its a bit "*dishonest*" to say that `FilterLink`
is a "*Presentational*" Component
because it is inseparable from its *behavior*
the only *reasonable* reaction to clicking on it
is setting the `visibilityFilter` by dispatching an `action`
this is why I am changing it to a *different* "*Presentational*" Component
I'm going to call `Link`
and I will create another `FilterLink` Component
as a Container that uses it for rendering.

```js
const Link = ({
  active,
  children,
  onClick
}) => {
  if (active) {
    return <span>{children}</span>;
  }

  return (
    <a href='#'
      onClick={e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        onClick();
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};

```

The `Link` Component doesn't know *anything* about the `Filter`
it only accepts the `active` prop and calls its `onClick` handler
it is *only* concerned with rendering
however I am *also* creating another Component called `FilterLink`
and its going to be a `Class` this time.
It's going to `render` the `Link`
with the *current* data from the `store`.
It's going to read the props, the Component props
and it's going to read the `state`
but I don't mean the *React* `state`
I mean the Redux `store` state
it gets by calling `store.getState()`.
As a "*Container*" Component the `FilterLink`
doesn't have its *own* markup
and it delegates rendering to the `Link`
"*Presentational*" Component.
In this case it *calculates* its `active` prop
by comparing its *own* `filter` prop
with the `visibilityFilter` in the Redux `store` `state`.
The `filter` prop is the one that is passed
to the `FilterLink` from the `Footer`
and the `visibilityFilter` corresponds to the
*currently* chosen `visibilityFilter`
that is held in the Redux `store` `state`.
and if they *match* we want the `Link` to appear *active*
(*un-clickable*).
The "*Container*" Component also needs to specify the *behavior*
so in this case the `FilterLink`
specifies that when this particular link is *clicked*
we should dispatch the `action` with the `type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'`
and the `filter` value that we take from the props
the `FilterLink` may accept "*Children*"
which are used as the *contents* of the `Link`
so we are going to pass the *children* down
to the `Link` Component which is going to `render` them
inside the `<a>` tag.

```js
class FilterLink extends Component {
  render() {
    const props = this.props;
    const state = store.getState();

    return (
      <Link
        active={
          props.filter ===
          state.visibilityFilter
        }
        onClick={() =>
          store.dispatch({
            type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
            filter: props.filter
          })
        }
      >
        {props.children}
      </Link>
    );
  }
}
```

There is a *small problem* with this implementation of `FilterLink`
inside the `render` method it reads the *current* `state`
of the Redux `store` however it is not *subscribed* to this `store`.
So if the *Parent* Component does not update when
the `store` is updated its going to render the "*stale*" value.

Currently we re-render the *whole* application when the `state` changes
however this is *not* very efficient
so in future we will instead move the *subscription* to the `store`
to the lifecycle methods of the "*Container*" Components.
React provides a *special* `forceUpdate` method
on the Component instances to *force* their re-rendering
and we're going to use it together with `store.subscribe` method
so that any time the `store` `state` changes
we `forceUpdate` the "*Container*" Components.
We perform the subscription inside the `componentDidMount`
lifecycle method so its important to
to *unsubscribe* inside the `componentWillUnmount` method.

```js
class FilterLink extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
      this.forceUpdate()
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.unsubscribe();
  }

  render() {
    const props = this.props;
    const state = store.getState();

    return (
      <Link
        active={
          props.filter ===
          state.visibilityFilter
        }
        onClick={() =>
          store.dispatch({
            type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
            filter: props.filter
          })
        }
      >
        {props.children}
      </Link>
    );
  }
}

```

Note that we don't actually have the `unsubscribe` method,
but this is the returned value of the `store.subscribe` method
so we can keep it and then *call* it in `componentWillUnmount`.

Let's re-cap this part:
the `FilterLink` Component subscribes to the `store`
calling `forceUpdate` any time the `store` changes
so it can `render` the *current* `state` of the `store`.
it saves the *reference* to the `unsubscribe` function
returned by `store.subscribe`
and it *invokes* it when the Component is about to *Unmount*
to clean up the subscription.

Let's re-cap the relationship between the
`FilterLink` "*Container*" Component
and the `Link` "*Presentational*" Component:
The `Link` Component only specifies the *appearance* of a link
when it is *active* or *inactive*
but it doesn't know about the behavior.
The `FilterLink` Component is a *Container*
so it provides the *data* and the *behavior* for
the "*Presentational*" Component.
When it mounts it subscribes to the `store` so
it *independently* re-renders when the `store` `state` changes
because it needs to use the `store` *current* `state`
inside its `render` method.
Instead of specifying the DOM tree
it delegates all the rendering to
the `Link` "*Presentational*" Component
and its only job is to calculate the props
base on its *own* props and the *current* `state` of the Redux `store`
and it also specifies the callbacks that are
going to dispatch the `actions` on the `store`.

After the `action` is dispatched the `store` will remember
the *new* `state` returned by the reducer
and will call *every* subscriber to the `store`
and this case every `FilterLink` Component instance
is subscribed to the `store`
so they will all have their `forceUpdate` methods called on them
and they will re-render according to the *current* `store` `state`.

The `FilterLink` is a "*Container*" Component
so it is completely self-sufficient
and can be used inside the "*Presentational*" Components such as
`Footer` without passing additional props
to get the data from the `store` and specify the behavior
this lets us keep the `Footer` Component simple
and de-coupled from the behavior and data
that its child Components need.

#### 23. Extracting Container Components (VisibleTodoList, AddTodo)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-container-components-visibletodolist-addtodo

In the previous lesson I separated the
`Link` "*Presentational*" Component from the
`FilterLink` "*Container*" Component
that is subscribed to the Redux `store`
and that provides the *data* and the *behavior*
for the `Link` Component it renders.
While it makes the data flow a little bit *less* explicit
it makes it easier to use `FilterLink` in
*any* Component without worrying about passing additional data
to the `FilterLink` or to the Component that *contains* it.

In *this* lesson we will continue extracting
the "*Container*" Components from the top-level
"*Container*" Component and the *first* candidate is
the `TodoList` Component.

I actually want to *keep* the `TodoList` a "*Presentational*" Component
however I want to *encapsulate* within the *currently*
visible Todos into a *separate* "*Container*" Component
that connects the `TodoList` to the Redux `store`
so I'm going to call this Component the `VisibleTodoList`.
Just like when declaring the `FilterLink` Component
in the *previous* lesson, I calculate the data for the *current*
Component by using the *current* `state`
which is the `state` from the Redux `store`
and I'm using the `getVisibleTodos` function
to calculate the *currently* visible todos
based on all the todos from the Redux `store`
and the *current* `visibilityFilter` from the Redux `store` `state`
and I'm specifying the *behavior* as well
I'm saying that when the todo is *clicked*
we should dispatch an `action` with `type: 'TOGGLE_TODO'`
and the `id` of the todo being clicked.
All "*Container*" Components are similar
their job is to *connect* a "*Presentational*" Component
to the Redux `store` and specify the data and the behavior
that it needs.

```js
class VisibleTodoList extends Component {
  render() {
    const props = this.props;
    const state = store.getState();
    return (
      <TodoList
        todos={
          getVisibleTodos(
            state.todos,
            state.visibilityFilter
          )
        }
        onTodoClick={id =>
          store.dispatch({
            type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
            id
          })
        }
    )
  }
}
```

I'm scrolling up to the `FilterLink` *Container* Component
I wrote in the *previous* lesson to *cut-paste*
the `store` *subscription* logic:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =>
    this.forceUpdate()
  );
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  this.unsubscribe();
}
```

Just like the `FilterLink` the `VisibleTodoList` is
going to *subscribe* to the `store`
and *force* an update any time the `store` `state` changes
because it uses the `state` in its `render` method.
Now that the `VisibleTodoList` is connected to the Redux `store`
we can use it *instead* of the `TodoList`
and we no longer have to pass all the props from the top.

*Finally* in the *previous* lesson
I made `AddTodo` a *Presentational* Component
but I'm going to ***back-track*** on this now.
I will *cut-paste* the `dispatch` call back inline
into the `onClick` handler inside the Component
because there isn't really a lot of presentation or *behavior* here
and its *easier* to keep them together
until we figure out how to split the *presentation*.
For example if in the *future* we're going to have something
like a `<form>` Component we may split it
but for now we'll keep them together.

I'm scrolling down to my `TodoApp` Component
and I'm removing the `onAddClick` prop
and I just noticed that *none* of the *Containers* actually
need props from the `state`
so I can *remove* the props of the `TodoApp` Component
and I can *remove* the `render` function that
renders the `TodoApp` Component with
the *current* `state` of the `store`
because I can just call it *once*
remove all the props that are related to the `state`
and just `render` it *as is*
because the *Container* Components that I render
are going to `subscribe` to the `store` *themselves*
and are going to *update* themselves when the `store` `state` changes.

```js
const TodoApp = () => (
  <div>
    <AddTodo />
    <VisibleTodoList />
    <Footer />
  </div>
)

ReactDOM.render(
  <TodoApp />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Lets re-cap the data flow after separating
the *Presentational* and the *Container* Components.

There is just *one* `ReactDOM.render` call
at the very end and we don't `render` again
when the `store` `state` changes
because the *Container* Components take care of that!
The *first* Component I'm looking at is called `AddTodo`
and frankly I can't classify it either as a *Presentational* Component
*or* as a *Container* Component because it doesn't fit either category.
The `<input>` and the `<button>` are the *Presentational* part
but dispatching an `action` `onClick` is the *behavior*
which is *usually* specified by the *Container*
however in *this* case I'd rather keep them together
because there isn't any `state`, the **UI** is *very simple*
and its hard to imagine any *other* behavior
other than dispatching the `ADD_TODO` `action`.

The *second* Component I render inside the `TodoApp` is
`VisibleTodoList`, and this time it is a "proper" *Container* Component
that subscribes to the `store` and re-renders
the `TodoList` any time the `store` `state` changes
and it *calculates* the `visibleTodos`
from the *current* Redux `store` `state`, the todos and
`visibilityFilter` fields and it passes them as the `todos` (prop)
and when the `todos` are *clicked*
its going to `dispatch` an `action` with the `type:'TOGGLE_TODO'`
and the `id` of the *respective* `todo`
the *actual* rendering here is performed
by the `TodoList` Component that just renders the Todos
passed through as prop and binds their clicks to the `onTodoClick` prop.

*Finally* the *last* Component the `TodoApp` renders is the `Footer`
and the `Footer` is just a *Presentational* Component
rendering **3** different `FilterLink`s.
The `FilterLink` is a *Container* Component
so it *subscribes* to the `store`
and it renders the *Presentational* Component called `Link`
calculating weather it should be *active* based on its props
the *current* Redux `store` `state`
and it specifies the *behavior*
(*what happens when it's clicked*).
*Finally* the `Link` Component is just a *Presentational* Component
that renders an `<a>` tag.

Separating the *Container* and the *Presentational* Components
is often a good idea, but you shouldn't take it as a
"[*dogma*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma)";
Only do this when it *truly* reduces the *complexity*
of your codebase. In general I suggest *first* trying to
extract the *Presentational* Components,
and if there is *too much* boilerplate
passing the props to them then you can create the *Containers*
around them that load the data and specify the *behavior*.

#### 24. Passing the Store Down Explicitly via Props

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-passing-the-store-down-explicitly-via-props

In the *previous* lessons we used the `store` top level variable
to refer to the Redux `store`.
The Components that *access* the `store` such as
the *Container* Components read the `state` from it,
`subscribe` to the `store` and dispatch *actions* on the `store`
using the `store` top level variable.
This approach works fine for a "*JS Bin*" example where
everything is in a *single* file
however it doesn't *scale* to "*real*" applications
for *several* reasons.
*First* of all it makes your *Container* Components harder to *test*
because they reference a *specific* `store`
but you might want to supply a *different* "*Mock*" `store`
in the *Tests*.
*Secondly* it makes it very hard to implement "*Universal Applications*"
that are rendered on the *server*
because on the *server* you want to supply a different `store`
instance for every `request` because different requests
have different *data*.

I'm going to *start* by moving the `store` creation code
to the *bottom* of the file where I `render` my React Components.
I'm going to change it *slightly*
and *instead* of creating the `store` top level variable
I will pass the `store` I create as a prop
to the top level Component
so it is completely "*injectable*" to it.
Every *Container* Component needs a reference to the `store`
so *unfortunately* we have to pass it down to every Component
as a prop.
Its *less effort* than passing different *data* to every Component
but its still *inconvenient*
so don't worry, we'll find a *better* solution later.
But for *now* we need to see the problem.

```js
const TodoApp = ({ store }) => (
  <div>
    <AddTodo store={store} />
    <VisibleTodoList store={store} />
    <Footer store={store} />
  </div>
)

const { createStore } =  Redux;

ReactDOM.render(
  <TodoApp store={createStore(todoApp)} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The *problem* is that the *Container* Components
need to have the `store` instance to get the `state` from it,
dispatch *actions* and get the changes.
So this time I'm changing the *Container* Component
to take the `store` from the `props` using the **ES6** ***Destructuring Syntax*** which just means `const { store } = props.store;` ...

> **Note**: destructuring **Objects** is not yet available in *any* browser, so I'm using "traditional" variable assignment: `const store = props.store;` (*almost identical*!)

And I'm doing the *same* here, just taking the `store` from the `props`
so I can call `dispatch` on it.

I need to make similar changes to other *Container* Components
and in this case I have this `AddTodo` Component,
which is not *exactly* a *Container* Component
but it still needs the `store` to `dispatch` the `ADD_TODO` `action`
so I add it as a `prop`.
And I'm also going to add the `store` to the `Footer` Component
because *unfortunately* `FilterLink` needs it
and the `Footer` Component renders `FilterLink`.
So this is not *convenient* but as I said,
we'll figure out a way to avoid this *later*
but for *now* we need to pass the `store` down
so that *every* *Container* Component such as `FilterLink`
can use it to `subscribe` to the changes,
to *read* the `state` and to `dispatch` actions
without relying on a top-level variable being available.
I'm changing the `render` method to read the `store`
from the `props` and now all *Containers*
read the `store` instance from the `props`
and don't rely on a top-level variable that I removed.


Note that this change did not change the behavior or *data* flow
of this application.
The *Container* Components `subscribe` to the `store`
just like *before* and update their `state`
in response to its changes,
however what changed is how they *access* the `store`.
Previously they would *access* a top-level variable
but this approach does not *scale*
to "*real world*" applications
and this is why right now I'm passing down the `store`
as a `prop` so the *Container* Components can `subscribe` to it.

In the *future* lessons we will see how to pass the `store` down
to the *Container* Components *implicitly*
but without introducing the top level variable.

#### 25. Passing the Store Down Implicitly via Context

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-passing-the-store-down-implicitly-via-context

In the previous lesson we got rid of the top-level `store` variable
and instead started passing the `store` as a `prop` to the `TodoApp`
Component so *every* Component below received the `store`
as a `prop`. And we even have to do this for *Presentational* Components
because sometimes they contain *Container* Components
that need the `store` to `subscribe` to the changes.
We have to write a lot of "*boilerplate*" code
to pass the `store` down as a `prop`
but there is *another* way using the "*advanced*" React feature
called "***Context***".

I'm creating a *new* Component called `Provider`
and from its `render` method it just returns what ever its *child* is.
So we can *wrap* any Component in a `Provider`
and it's going to `render` that Component.

```js
class Provider extends Component {
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

I'm changing the `render` call
to render a `TodoApp` inside the `Provider`
and I'm moving the `store` `prop` from the `TodoApp`
to the `Provider` Component.

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={createStore(todoApp)}>
  <TodoApp />,
  </Provider>
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The `Provider` Component will use the React
*advanced* ***Context*** Feature to make the `store`
available to *any* Component inside it
including "*Grand Children*".
To do this it has to define a special method called
`getChildContext` that will be *called* by React.
We are using `this.props.store` which corresponds to
`store` passed to the `Provider` as a `prop` just *once*.
*this* `store` will be part of the *Context*
that the `Provider` specifies
for any "*Children*" and "*Grand Children*"
so the `TodoApp` is going to receive this *Context*
and any Component inside `TodoApp` is going to receive
this *Context* `Object` with the `store` inside it.
However there is an *important condition* for the *Context* to work,
and this *condition* is that you have to specify
`childContextTypes` on the Component that defines
`getChildContext` these are just `React.PropTypes` definitions
but *unlike* `PropTypes`, the `ChildContext` Types are ***essential***
for the *Context* to be turned on.
If you don't specify them, no *Child* Components
will receive this *Context*.

The *Container* Components *currently* access `store` by `props`
but we are going to change this to read the `store` from React *Context*
and to do that we just refer to `this.context`
similarly in the `render` method I'm also going to *read* the `store`
from the *Context* instead of the `props`:

```js
const store = this.context.store; // no ES6 required.
```

*Finally* the *Context* is "*Opt In*"
for the *receiving* Components *too*
so you *have* to *specify* a special field called `contextTypes`
which are *similar* to `childContextTypes`
but in this case we are specifying which Context we
want to *receive* and not pass down.

```js
VisibleTodoList.contextTypes = {
  store: React.PropTypes.object
}
```
If you *forget* to declare the `contextTypes`
the Component will *not* receive the relevant Context
so it is ***essential*** to remember to declare them.

What about the *functional* Components that don't have [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
(*JavaScript context*).
It turns out that they *also* receive the Context
but as a *second* argument *after* the `props`
so I'm destructuring the *second argument*
and getting the `store` from there
and the *second argument* is the Context.
Just like with the `class` Components
I still have to add a property called `contextTypes`
that specifies which *Context* I want to receive
and in this case I want to receive the `store` from the `Provider`.
If I *forget* to declare the `contextTypes`
my *functional* Component will not receive the relevant *Context*
as the *second argument*.

```js
AddTodo.contextTypes = {
  store: React.PropTypes.object
}
```
So, its *important* to *remember* to declare them
any time you *use* the *Context*.
*Finally* I'm replacing the `props` with the `context`
when getting the `store` for the `FilterLink`
and I'm adding the `contextTypes` declaration
to the `FilterLink` so it receives the relevant *Context*
from the `Provider`.
Now that the `FilterLink` receives the `store` by `context`
I no longer need to pass it as a `prop`
so I'm removing its usage (*from the `Footer` Component*)
and I'm also removing the `store` prop from the `Footer`
because it doesn't need to pass it down anymore.

I'm also removing the `store` prop from the `TodoApp` Component
because I no longer need to pass it down to the *Containers*.
Now instead of *explicitly* passing the `store` down
by `props`, we pass it *implicitly* by `context`.

Lets recap how we use the `context` to pass the `store` down:
We *start* by *rendering* the `TodoApp`
inside the `Provider` Component we defined above.
The `Provider` Component just *renders*
what ever you pass to it
so in this case it renders its "*Children*"
or [*more specifically*] the `TodoApp` component
however it also provides the `context`
to *any* Components inside it, including "*Grand Children*"
the `context` contains just *one* key called the `store`
and it corresponds to the `store` we passed as a `prop`
to the `Provider` Component.
We pass the `store` to the `Provider` Component in our `render` call
and make it available to "*Child Components*"
by defining the `getChildContext` with the `store` key
pointing to that `prop`.
It is ***essential*** that the `getChildContext`
is matched by `childContextTypes`
where we specify that the `store` key has `PropTypes`
of `object`.

> Note: that the `childContextTypes` definition
is ***absolutely required***
if you want to pass the `context` down the tree.

The benefit is that we don't need to pass the `store`
through the *intermediate* components
and instead we can declare the `contextTypes`
on the *Container* Components that need access to the `store`
so that they can retrieve it from the `context`
instead of retrieving it from the `props`.
The `context` creates something like a "*worm hole*"
between the `VisibleTodoList` Component that reads the `context`
and the `Provider` that *provides* the `context`
and this "*worm hole*" is only *enabled*
because the `contextTypes` declared on the `VisibleTodoList`
include the `store` that is defined in `childContextTypes`
of the `Provider` Component.

The `AddTodo` is another Component that needs *access* to the `store`
so it also *opts-in* to receiving it in the `context`
by specifying the `contextTypes`
this is why in *addition* to `props`,
it receives a *second argument* which is the `context`
I'm using the *destructuring* syntax here so instead of:

```js
const AddTodo = (props, context) => {
const store = context.store; // need to manually assign the store from context
// rest of code ...
```
we get a simplified version:

```js
const AddTodo = (props, { store }) => {
// rest of code ...
```
The `context` works at *any* depth
so it is not necessary to put `contextTypes` on the `Footer`
the `FilterLink` is the Component that *directly* uses the `context`
so this is the component that has to *specify* the `contextTypes`
so that it can use the `store` by reading it from the `context`.

Context is a *powerful feature*
but in a way it contradicts the React philosophy
of the ***explicit data flow***.
The `context` essentially allows ***Global Variables***
across the Component Tree
but ***Global Variables*** are *usually* a ***Bad Idea*** ...
and unless you're using it for dependency injection
like here where we need to make a *single* `Object`
available to all Components,
then probably you *shouldn't* use `context` ...

*Finally* the Context API is ***NOT Stable*** in React!
It has changed before and it is likely to change again
so try your best not to rely on it too much.

#### 26. Passing the Store Down with &lt;Provider&gt; from React Redux

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-passing-the-store-down-with-provider-from-react-redux

In the *previous* lesson we implemented the `Provider` Component
that uses the React "*Advanced*" Context Feature
to make the `store` from the `props` available
to *every* Component in our App.
So if we pass it to the `Provider`
we can read it in *any* other Component from the `context`
which is *really* convenient for the *Container* Components.
In fact this is *so* convenient
that you don't actually *need* to write the `Provider` *yourself*
because it is included in a "*special library*"
called ***React-Redux***

```js
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-redux/4.0.5/react-redux.js"></script>
```
And note that this is *not* the same a Redux,
this is a *different* library
these are *React bindings* to the Redux Library.

You can import the `Provider` by *destructuring* the `ReactRedux`
***Global*** `Object` in JSBin:
```js
const { Provider } = ReactRedux;
```
***or*** if you use `Babel`
and something like `npm`
you can:

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
```

with the braces because it is a *named* `export`
from the `react-redux` package.
Or if you write **ES5** code, you can write:

```js
var Provider = require('react-redux').Provider;
```

Just like the `Provider` we wrote *before*,
the `Provider` that comes with `ReactRedux`
exposes the `store` you pass to it as a `prop`
on the `context` so the Components can specify
the `contextTypes` and then use `this.context.store`
to `subscribe` to the `store` updates and `dispatch` *actions*.

#### 27. Generating Containers with `connect()` from React Redux (VisibleTodoList)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-generating-containers-with-connect-from-react-redux-visibletodolist


In the previous lesson I added `ReactRedux` bindings to the project
and I used the `Provider` Component from `ReactRedux`
to pass the `store` down the `context`
so that the *Container* Components can *read* the `store`
from the `context` and `subscribe` to its changes.
All *Container* Components are *very similar*,
they need to *re-render* when the `store` `state` changes
they need to `unsubscribe` from the `store` when they `Unmount`.
and they take the *current* `state` of the Redux `store`
and use it to `render` the *Presentational* Components
with some `props` that they *calculate* from the `state` of the `store`
and they *also* need to *specify* the `contextTypes`
to get the `store` from the `context`.

I'm going to write this Component in a *different* way now:
and I'll declare a function called `mapStateToProps`
which takes the Redux `store` `state`
and returns the `props` that I need to pass to the
*Presentational* `TodoList` Component
to `render` it with the *current* `state`.
In this case there is just a *single* `prop` called `todos`
so I *cut-paste* this expression:

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(
      state.todos,
      state.visibilityFilter
    )
  };
};
```
It returns the `props` that *depend* on the *current*
`state` of the Redux `store`
so in *this* case this is just the `todos` prop.

I'm creating another function
that I call `mapDispatchToProps`
and it accepts the `dispatch` method from the `store`
as the *only* argument and returns
the `props` that should be passed to the `TodoList` Component
and that *depend* on the `dispatch` method.
The *only* `prop` that uses `store.dispatch`
is called `onTodoClick`
so I'm *copy-pasting* [*cut-and-pasting*] `onTodoClick`
into `mapDispatchToProps`.
Note that I don't have the reference to the `store` here *anymore*
so instead I'm changing it to use *just* the `dispatch`
which is provided as an *argument* to `mapDispatchToProps`
"I will add some *punctuation* to make it *appear* easier on my eyes"
[*parenthesis around the `id` argument
& curly-braces around the function block*]
`onTodoClick` is a function that accepts the `id`
of the `todo` and dispatches an `action`.

```js
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    onTodoClick: (id) => {
      dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
        id
      })
    }
  };
}
```

Now I've got two different functions:
The *first* one *maps* the Redux `store` `state`
to the `props` of the `TodoList` Component
that are *related* to the *data* from the Redux `store`
the *second* function maps the `dispatch` method of the `store`
to the callback `props` of the `TodoList` Component
it specifies the *behavior*
that is which callback `prop` dispatches which `action`.

Together these two functions describe the a *Container* Component
*so* well that instead of *writing* it
I can *generate* it by using the `connect` function
provided by the `ReactRedux` Library:

```js
const { connect } = ReactRedux;
```
If you use `npm` and `Babel` you will
likely *import* it like *this* instead:

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
```
"*and don't forget the curly braces*..."
[*destructuring assignment of the `connect` method from the `react-redux` package*]

Now, instead of declaring a `class` I'm going to declare a `variable`
and I will call the `connect` method to *obtain* it.
I'm passing `mapStateToProps` as the *first* argument,
and `mapDispatchToProps` as the *second* argument.
And notice that this is a
["*curried*"](https://github.com/iteles/Javascript-the-Good-Parts-notes#curry)
function so I have to call it once *again*
and this time I pass the *Presentational* Component
that I want it to *wrap* and pass the `props` to.

```js
const VisibleTodoList = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(TodoList);
```

The `connect` function will *generate* the Component
will *generate* the Component just like the one
I *previously* wrote by *hand*
so I don't want you to write the *code*
to `subscribe` to the `store` or to *specify* the `contextTypes`
because the `connect` function takes care of that.

> At 03:27 Dan *deletes* the "old" `VisibleTodoList` Component
and its `contextTypes` definition which
are *both* now being *generated* by the `connect` call.

Now lets re-cap how to *generate* the *Container* Component
using the `connect` function:

*First* I write a `function` called `mapStateToProps`
that takes the `state` of the Redux `store`
and returns the `props` for the *Presentational* Component
calculated from it.
These `props` will be *updated* any time the `state` changes
*Next* I write a `function` that I call `mapDispatchToProps`
it takes the `store.dispatch` method as it's *first* argument
and it returns the `props` that *use* the `dispatch` method
to `dispatch` *actions*,
so it *returns* the callback `props`
needed for the *Presentational* Component.

To create a *Container* Component from them,
I *import* `connect` from the `ReactRedux` library
and I *call* it passing `mapStateToProps`
as the *first* argument and `mapDispatchToProps`
as the *second* argument.
*Finally*, I close the function call parens,
and I *open* another [*pair of*] parentheses
because this is a *curried* function and it needs to be
*called* ***twice***
and the last argument is the *Presentational* Component
that I want to *connect* to the Redux `store`.
The *result* of the `connect` call
is the *Container* Component
that is going to `render` my *Presentational* Component
it will calculate the `props` to pass to the
*Presentational* Component by merging the objects
returned from `mapStateToProps`, `mapDispatchToProps`
and its *own* `props`.

#### 28. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (AddTodo)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-generating-containers-with-connect-from-react-redux-addtodo

In the *previous* lesson we used the `connect` function from
`ReactRedux` bindings library to *generate*
the *Container* Component that *renders*
a *Presentational* Component.
I *specify* how to calculate the `props` to "*inject*"
from the *current* Redux `store` `state`
and the callback `props` to *inject*
from the `dispatch` function on the Redux `store`.

*Normally* I would keep these functions
called `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`,
but I'm working in a *single* file right now
and I need to write these functions for a few *other*
*Container* Components so I'm going to *re-name*
them to something more *specific*:

+ `mapStateToProps` becomes `mapStateToTodoListProps`
+ `mapDispatchToProps` becomes `mapDispatchToTodoListProps`

Which you don't *have* to do in your code,
if you keep each Component in its *own* file (which is considered to be a best practise).

I will also remove the line-breaks here
to make it *clear* that these functions are only relevant
for generating this particular *Container* Component.

Final Code (*after re-naming*):

```js
const mapStateToTodoListProps = (state) => {
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(
      state.todos,
      state.visibilityFilter
    )
  };
};
const mapDispatchToTodoListProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    onTodoClick: (id) => {
      dispatch({
        type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
        id
      })
    }
  };
}
const { connect } = ReactRedux;
const VisibleTodoList = connect(
  mapStateToTodoListProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(TodoList);
```

Now I'm *scrolling* up to the `AddTodo` Component
which is not clearly a *Container* or a *Presentational* Component.
However it uses the `store`,
it *reads* the `store` from the `context`
to `dispatch` an `action` when the `<button>` is *clicked*
and it *has* to declare the `contextTypes`
to be able to grab the `store` from the `context`.
[React] Context is a an ***unstable API*** so
it's best to ***avoid using*** it ***in application code***.

Instead of reading the `store` from the `context`,
I will read the `dispatch` function from the `props`,
because I only need the `dispatch` here.
I don't *need* the whole `store`,
and I will create a *Container* Component with `connect`
that will *inject* the `dispatch` function as a `prop`.
I will *remove* the `contextTypes`
[*from the `AddTodo` Component*]
because the Component generated by `connect` function
will take care of reading the `store` from the `context`.

Because I changed the `AddTodo` declaration
from the `const` to the `let` binding,
I can re-assign it now,
so that the *consuming* Component does not need to *specify*
the `dispatch` prop because it will be *injected*
by the Component *generated* by the `connect` call.
The *first* argument to the `connect` function is `mapStateToProps`,
but there aren't any `props` for `AddTodo` Component
that *depend* on the *current* `state`,
so I `return` an *empty* `Object`.
The *second* argument to `connect` is `mapDispatchToProps`,
but `AddTodo` Component doesn't *need* any callback `props`.
It just accepts the `dispatch` function itself,
so I'm returning it as a `prop` with the *same name*.
*Finally* I'm calling the function for a *second* time
to specify the Component I want to *wrap*,
in this case `AddTodo` itself:

`AddTodo` with the re-assignment as a call to `connect`:

```js
let AddTodo = ({ dispatch }) => {
  let input;

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={node => {
        input = node;
      }} />
      <button onClick={() => {
        dispatch({
          type: 'ADD_TODO',
          id: nextTodoId++,
          text: input.value
        })
        input.value = '';
      }}>
        Add Todo
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
AddTodo = connect(
  state => {
    return {};
  },
  dispatch => {
    return { dispatch };
  }
)(AddTodo);
```

The *generated* *Container* Component
will not pass any `props` dependent on the `state`,
but it will pass `dispatch` itself
as a `function` so that the Component can read it from the `props`
and use it without worrying about *context*
or specifying `contextTypes`.
However it is *wasteful* to even `subscribe` to the `store`
if we don't calculate any `props` from its `state`,
so I'm *replacing* the `mapStateToProps` function with a `null`,
which tells `connect` that there is *no need*
to `subscribe` to the `store`.
Additionally its a pretty *common pattern*
to *inject just the `dispatch` function*,
so this is why if you specify `null` or any "*falsy*" value
in `connect` as the *second* argument
you're going to get `dispatch` injected as a `prop`.

So in fact I can just ***remove all arguments*** here
and the *default* behavior will be to *not* `subscribe`
to the `store` and to *inject* just the `dispatch` function
as a `prop`.

```js
AddTodo = connect()(AddTodo);
```

03:44 - Let's re-cap what happens to the Components here:
The `AddTodo` Component that I declare
accepts `dispatch` as a `prop`,
but it doesn't know how to *get* the `store`.
It just "*hopes*" that "*someone*" is going
to *pass* `dispatch` to it.
The `connect` call without any arguments is going
to *generate* a *Container* Component
that does *not* `subscribe` to the `store`.
However that will pass `dispatch` to the Component that it *wraps*
and in this case it *wraps* my `AddTodo` Component

The *second* `connect` call returns the *generated*
*Container* Component and I'm assigning it to `AddTodo`,
so I'm re-assigning the `let` binding the second time,
and when the further code references `AddTodo`
it's going to reference the *Container* Component
that does not need the `dispatch` prop
and that will pass the `dispatch` prop
to my *inner* `AddTodo` Component
that I don't have a reference to anymore.

#### 29. Generating Containers with connect() from React Redux (FooterLink)

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-generating-containers-with-connect-from-react-redux-footerlink

*Finally* let's take a look at the `FilterLink`
*Container* Component that renders a `Link` with an `active` property
and a *click* handler.
*First* I will write the `mapStateToProps` function
which I will call `mapStateToLinkProp`
because I have everything in a *single* file.
And it's going to accept the `state` of the Redux `store`
and `return` the `props` that should be passed to the `Link`
and we only have a *single* such `prop` called `active`
that determines whether the link displays
the *current* `visiblityFilter`.
When I *paste* this *expression* from the `render` method
I see that it references the `filter` prop
of the `FilterLink` Component.
To tell whether a link is *active* we need to
compare this `prop` with with the `visibilityFilter`
from the Redux `store` `state`
it is fairly common to use the *Container* `props`
when calculating the *Child* `props`
so this is why `props` are passed as a *second* argument
to `mapStateToProps` [*or in this example `mapStateToLinkProps`*]
I will re-name it [*the `mapStateToLinkProps` second argument*]
to `ownProps` to make it clear that
we are talking about the *Container* Component's *own* `props`
and not the `props` that are *passed* to the *Child*
which is the `return` value of `mapStateToLinkProps`

```js
const mapStateToLinkProps = (
  state,
  ownProps
) => {
  return {
    active:
      ownProps.filter ===
      state.visibilityFilter
  }
}
```

The second function I'm writing here is `mapDispatchToProps`
or to avoid name clashes in the JSBin [*single file app*]
`mapDispatchToLinkProps`.
The only argument so far is the `dispatch` function
and I'm going to need to look at the *Container* Component
I wrote by hand to see what `props` depend on the `dispatch` function.
In this case this is just the `onClick` handler
where I `dispatch` the `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` `action`.
the only `prop` I'm passing down is called `onClick`
and I declare it as an **ES6** [***Arrow Function***]()
with no arguments and I *paste* the `dispatch` call.

```js
const mapDispatchToLinkProps = (
  dispatch
) => {
  return {
    onClick: () => {
      dispatch({
        type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
        filter: props.filter
      });
    }
  };
}
```

But it references the `props` *again*,
so I need to add `ownProps` as an *argument*
the *second* argument to `mapDispatchToLinkProps` function
thus:

```js
const mapDispatchToLinkProps = (
  dispatch,
  ownProps
) => {
  return {
    onClick: () => {
      dispatch({
        type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
        filter: ownProps.filter
      });
    }
  };
}
```

*Finally* I will call the `connect` function from `ReactRedux` Library
to generate the `FilterLink` *Container* Component
I pass the relevant `mapStateToProps` function
as the *first* argument [*in our case `mapStateToLinkProps`*]
the `mapDispatchToProps` as the *second* argument
[*or `mapDispatchToLinkProps` in our case*]
and I call the function *again* with the `Link` Component
which should be *rendered*:

```js
const FilterLink = connect(
  mapStateToLinkProps,
  mapDispatchToLinkProps
)(Link);
```

Now I can *remove* the "*old*" `FilterLink` implementation.

Let's re-cap the *data flow* in this example:
the `Footer` Component renders **3** `FilterLink`
and each of them has a different `filter` prop
that specifies which `filter` it corresponds to
this `prop` will be available on the `ownProps` `Object`
that *both* `mapDispatchToProps` and `mapStateToProps`
will receive as the *second* argument.
we pass these two functions to the `connect` call
which will return a *Container* Component called `FilterLink`.
The `FilterLink` will take the `props`
that we `return` from the `mapDispatchToProps` and `mapStateToProps`
[*or the "Link" versions of these in our case...*]
and pass them as `props` the `Link` Component that it *wraps*
we can now use the `FilterLink` *Container* Component
and specify *just* the `filter`
but the *underlying* `Link` Component
will receive the *calculated* `active` and `onClick` values.

#### 30. Extracting Action Creators

> Video: https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-extracting-action-creators

So far we have covered the *Container* Components
the *Presentational* Components,
the Reducers and the `store`,
but we have not covered the concept of `action` *Creators*
which you might see in the Redux *talks* and *examples*.

Let's consider the following example:
I `dispatch` the `ADD_TODO` `action`
from inside the `<button>` `onClick` handler
and this is "*fine*",
however it references the `nextTodoId` variable
which I declare along side the `AddTodo` Component
*normally* it would be *local*
however what if another component wants to `dispatch`
the `ADD_TODO` `action` ?
It would need to have access to the `nextTodoId` somehow
and while I *could* make this variable *GLOBAL*
it's *not* a very good idea ...
instead it would be *best* if the Components
dispatching the `ADD_TODO` `action`
did not have to *worry* about specifying the `id`
because the only information they *really* pass
is the `text` of the `todo` being added
I don't *want* to generate the `id` inside the *reducer*
because that would make it *non-deterministic*
however I can extract this code
generating the `action` `Object`
into a function I will call `addTodo`
I pass the `input.value` to `addTodo`
and `addTodo` is just a function that takes
the `text` of the `todo` and constructs an `action` `Object`
representing `ADD_TODO` `action`.
So it has the `type: 'ADD_TODO'`,
it takes care of *generating* the `id`
and it includes the `text`.

```js
let nextTodoId = 0;
const addTodo = (text) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    id: nextTodoId++,
    text // implied value from function argument
  }
}
```

Although extracting such function is not required
it is a very common pattern in Redux applications
to keep them *maintainable*
so we call these functions `action` *Creators*
and we usually place them separately from Components
or from *Reducers*.

I will now *extract* other `action` *Creators* from the Components
and I see that I have a `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER` in a `dispatch` here
[*in the `mapDispatchToLinkProps` method*]
so I will change this to call the `setVisiblityFilter`
`action` *Creator* with the `ownProps.filter` as the argument
and it's going to `return` the `action`
that needs to be `dispatched`
so I'm declaring the `setVisibilityFilter` function
this is what I call an `action` *Creator* because
it takes the arguments *about* the `action`
and it returns the `action` `Object`
with the `type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'`
and the `filter` itself.

```js
const setVisibilityFilter = (filter) => {
  return {
    type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER',
    filter // implied value from argument
  }
}
```

You might think that this kind of code is "*boiler plate*"
and you would rather `dispatch` the `action` in-line
inside the Component
however don't *underestimate* how `action` *Creators*
*document* your software because they tell your *team*
what kinds of *actions* the Components can `dispatch`
and this kind of information can be *invaluable*
in *large* applications.

I will now scroll down to the *last* place where I call `dispatch`
with an *in-line* `action` `Object`
[*the `mapDispatchToTodoListProps` function*]
and I will *extract* that to add `toggleTodo` `action` *Creator*
to which I pass the `id` of the `todo` as the argument.

I'm now scrolling up to my `action` *Creators*
and I will add a new one that I call `toggleTodo`
it accepts the `id` as the argument
and it returns the `action` with the `type: 'TOGGLE_TODO'`
and this `id`:

```js
const toggleTodo = (id) => {
  return {
    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
    id // inferred value from argument
  };
};
```

Lets take a moment to consider how *convenient* it is
to have all the `action` Creators in a single place
so that I can use them from Components and Tests
without worrying about the *actions* internal structure.

Note that whether you use `action` Creators or *not*
the *data flow* is *exactly* the same
because I just called the `action` Creator to get
the `action` `Object` and then I call `dispatch`
just like I did *before* passing the `action`.
